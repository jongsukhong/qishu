	Abstract = {We present analytic formulae that approximate the evolution of stars for a wide range of mass M and metallicity Z. Stellar luminosity, radius and core mass are given as a function of age, M and Z, for all phases from the zero-age main sequence up to, and including, the remnant stages. For the most part we find continuous formulae accurate to within 5 per cent of detailed models. These formulae are useful for purposes such as population synthesis that require very rapid but accurate evaluation of stellar properties, and in particular for use in combination with N-body codes. We describe a mass-loss prescription that can be used with these formulae, and investigate the resulting stellar remnant distribution.},

	Abstract = {Among the 4908 stellar systems which have at least one resolvable component brighter than V = 6.00 are 115 systems with two or more resolvable components both brighter than V = 6.00. These bright stellar systems, both single and double, are modeled by a distribution convolving (1) formulas from theoretical models for stellar evolution, including giants as well as main-sequence stars, (2) an initial mass function and birth rate function, (3) a density distribution of stars as a function of distance from the Galactic plane, and (4) a distribution of mass ratios and orbital separations. One reasonably firm conclusion is that masses, even in wide binaries, are correlated: there are too many doubly bright visual binaries (DBVBs), by a factor of 3-5, to agree with the hypothesis that the component masses are selected independently from the same IMF or luminosity function. Another conclusion is that the number of DBVBs per decibel of separation a (absolute, not apparent) is not constant in the range a = 10-100,000 AU, but instead decreases slowly with increasing a.},

@article{Higuchi:2015aa,
	Abstract = {We have investigated the effect of stellar encounters on the formation and disruption of the Oort cloud using the classical impulse approximation. We calculate the evolution of a planetesimal disk into a spherical Oort cloud due to the perturbation from passing stars for 10 Gyr. We obtain the empirical fits of the e-folding time for the number of Oort cloud comets using the standard exponential and Kohlrausch formulae as functions of the stellar parameters and the initial semimajor axes of planetesimals. The e-folding time and the evolution timescales of the orbital elements are also analytically derived. In some calculations, the effect of the Galactic tide is additionally considered. We also show the radial variations of the e-folding times to the Oort cloud. From these timescales, we show that if the initial planetesimal disk has the semimajor axes distribution {dn}/{da}\propto {a}-2, which is produced by planetary scattering, the e-folding time for planetesimals in the Oort cloud is ~10 Gyr at any heliocentric distance r. This uniform e-folding time over the Oort cloud means that the supply of comets from the inner Oort cloud to the outer Oort cloud is sufficiently effective to keep the comet distribution as {dn}/{dr}\propto {r}-2. We also show that the final distribution of the semimajor axes in the Oort cloud is approximately proportional to {a}-2 for any initial distribution.},

@article{Brasser:2015aa,
	Abstract = {The detached object Sedna is likely at the inner edge of the Oort cloud, more precisely the inner Oort cloud (IOC). Until recently it was the sole member of this population. The recent discovery of the detached object 2012 VP113 has confirmed that there should be more objects in this region. Three additional IOC candidates with orbits much closer to Neptune have been proposed in the past decade since Sedna's discovery: 2000 CR105, 2004 VN112 and 2010 GB174. Sedna and 2012 VP113 have perhelia near 80 au and semimajor axes over 250 au. The latter three have perihelia between 44 and 50 au and semimajor axes between 200 and 400 au. Here we determine whether the latter three objects belong to the IOC or are from the Kuiper Belt's extended scattered disc (ESD) using numerical simulations. We assume that the IOC was formed when the Sun was in its birth cluster. We analyse the evolution of the IOC and the scattered disc (SD) during an episode of late giant planet migration. We examine the impact of giant planet migration in the context of four and five planets. We report that the detached objects 2004 VN112 and 2010 GB174 are likely members of the IOC that were placed there while the Sun was in its birth cluster or during an episode of solar migration in the Galaxy. The origin of 2000 CR105 is ambiguous but it is likely that it belongs to the ESD. Based on our simulations, we find that the maximum perihelion distance of SD objects is 41 au when the semimajor axis is higher than 250 au. Objects closer in are subject to mean-motion resonances with Neptune that may raise their perihelia. The five-planet model yields the same outcome. We impose a conservative limit and state that all objects with perihelion distance q > 45 au and semimajor axis a > 250 au belong to the IOC.},

@article{Zheng:2015aa,
	Abstract = {We carry out N-body simulations to examine the effects of dynamical interactions on planetary systems in young open star clusters. We explore how the planetary populations in these star clusters evolve, and how this evolution depends on the initial amount of substructure, the virial ratio, the cluster mass and density, and the initial semi-major axis of the planetary systems. The fraction of planetary systems that remains intact as a cluster member, fBPS, is generally well-described by the functional form fBPS = f0(1 + [a/a0]c)-1, where (1 - f0) is the fraction of stars that escapes from the cluster, a0 the critical semi-major axis for survival, and c a measure for the width of the transition region. The effect of the initial amount of substructure over time t can be quantified as fBPS = A(t) + B(D), where A(t) decreases nearly linearly with time, and B(D) decreases when the clusters are initially more substructured. Provided that the orbital separation of planetary systems is smaller than the critical value a0, those in clusters with a higher initial stellar density (but identical mass) have a larger probability of escaping the cluster intact. These results help us to obtain a better understanding of the difference between the observed fractions of exoplanets-hosting stars in star clusters and in the Galactic field. It also allows us to make predictions about the free-floating planet population over time in different stellar environments.},

@article{Welsh:2016aa,
	Abstract = {We present an archival study of 27 circumstellar Fe i (lambda3860 {\AA}) and Ca ii (lambda3933 {\AA}) absorption spectra of the beta Pictoris system recorded over the 2003-2014 timeframe. We have detected several transient absorption events at velocities red-shifted by >+20 km s-1 from the main central absorption line profiles of both Fe i and Ca ii. Such events can be attributed to the presence of kilometer-sized infalling evaporating bodies (i.e., exocomets) on their grazing approach to the central star. The majority of the transient absorption events detected in the Fe i profiles occur at velocities in the +35 to +50 km s-1 range. This is consistent with that found for Ca ii gas that has been sublimated from the ``D'' family of beta Pictoris exocomets recently found by Kiefer et al. These spectra also reveal that the strength of the main component of the Fe i absorption line at V helio ˜ +21 km s-1 has weakened by ˜30% since 2011. Since neutrals, when ionized, are the main source of the ion-braking mechanism of Brandeker for circumstellar gas in the beta Pictoris system, then this may have some measurable effect on the size and/or location of the main circumstellar gas disk. Finally we note that we have failed to detect any circumstellar Fe i absorption in our previously reported spectra of similar gas disks surrounding 28 young A-type stars. Thus, it would appear that the beta Pictoris is anomalous with regards to circumstellar Fe i absorption.},

	Abstract = {Instabilities in planetary systems can result in the ejection of planets from their host system, resulting in free-floating planets (FFPs). If this occurs in a star cluster, the FFP may remain bound to the star cluster for some time and interact with the other cluster members until it is ejected. Here, we use N-body simulations to characterize close star-planet and planet-planet encounters and the dynamical fate of the FFP population in star clusters containing 500-2000 single or binary star members. We find that FFPs ejected from their planetary system at low velocities typically leave the star cluster 40 per cent earlier than their host stars, and experience tens of close (<1000 au) encounters with other stars and planets before they escape. The fraction of FFPs that experiences a close encounter depends on both the stellar density and the initial velocity distribution of the FFPs. Approximately half of the close encounters occur within the first 30 Myr, and only 10 per cent occur after 100 Myr. The periastron velocity distribution for all encounters is well described by a modified Maxwell-Bolzmann distribution, and the periastron distance distribution is linear over almost the entire range of distances considered, and flattens off for very close encounters due to strong gravitational focusing. Close encounters with FFPs can perturb existing planetary systems and their debris structures, and they can result in re-capture of FFPs. In addition, these FFP populations may be observed in young star clusters in imaging surveys; a comparison between observations and dynamical predictions may provide clues to the early phases of stellar and planetary dynamics in star clusters.},

@article{Spurzem:2009aa,
	Abstract = {At least 10%-15% of nearby Sunlike stars have known Jupiter-mass planets. In contrast, very few planets are found in mature open and globular clusters such as the Hyades and 47 Tuc. We explore here the possibility that this dichotomy is due to the postformation disruption of planetary systems associated with the stellar encounters in long-lived clusters. One supporting piece of evidence for this scenario is the discovery of freely floating low-mass objects in star forming regions. We use two independent numerical approaches, a hybrid Monte Carlo and a direct N-body method, to simulate the impact of the encounters. We show that the results of numerical simulations are in reasonable agreement with analytical determinations in the adiabatic and impulsive limits. They indicate that distant stellar encounters generally do not significantly modify the compact and nearly circular orbits. However, moderately close stellar encounters, which are likely to occur in dense clusters, can excite planets' orbital eccentricity and induce dynamical instability in systems that are closely packed with multiple planets. The disruption of planetary systems occurs primarily through occasional nearly parabolic, nonadiabatic encounters, though eccentricity of the planets evolves through repeated hyperbolic adiabatic encounters that accumulate small-amplitude changes. The detached planets are generally retained by the potential of their host clusters as free floaters in young stellar clusters such as sigma Orionis. We compute effective cross sections for the dissolution of planetary systems and show that, for all initial eccentricities, dissolution occurs on timescales that are longer than the dispersion of small stellar associations, but shorter than the age of typical open and globular clusters. Although it is much more difficult to disrupt short-period planets, close encounters can excite modest eccentricity among them, such that subsequent tidal dissipation leads to orbital decay, tidal inflation, and even disruption of the close-in planets.},

@article{Shara:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Explaining the origin and evolution of exoplanetary hot Jupiters remains a significant challenge. One possible mechanism for the production of hot Jupiters is planet-planet interactions, which produce them from planets born far from their host stars but near their dynamical stability limits. In the much more likely case of planets born far from their dynamical stability limits, can hot Jupiters be formed in star clusters? Our N-body simulations answer this question in the affirmative, and show that hot Jupiter formation is not a rare event, occurring in ˜1% of star cluster planetary systems. We detail three case studies of the dynamics-induced births of hot Jupiters on highly eccentric orbits that can only occur inside star clusters. The hot Jupiters' orbits bear remarkable similarities to those of some of the most extreme exoplanets known: HAT-P-32b, HAT-P-2b, HD 80606b, and GJ 876d. If stellar perturbations formed these hot Jupiters, then our simulations predict that these very hot inner planets are often accompanied by much more distant gas giants in highly eccentric orbits.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a general-purpose framework for interconnecting scientific simulation programs using a homogeneous, unified interface. Our framework is intrinsically parallel, and conveniently separates all component numerical modules in memory. This strict separation allows automatic unit conversion, distributed execution of modules on different cores within a cluster or grid, and orderly recovery from errors. The framework can be efficiently implemented and incurs an acceptable overhead. In practice, we measure the time spent in the framework to be less than 1% of the wall-clock time. Due to the unified structure of the interface, incorporating multiple modules addressing the same physics in different ways is relatively straightforward. Different modules may be advanced serially or in parallel. Despite initial concerns, we have encountered relatively few problems with this strict separation between modules, and the results of our simulations are consistent with earlier results using more traditional monolithic approaches. This framework provides a platform to combine existing simulation codes or develop new physical solver codes within a rich "ecosystem" of interchangeable modules.},

@article{Perets:2012aa,
	Abstract = {In recent years, several planets have been discovered at wide orbits (>100 AU) around their host stars. Theoretical studies encounter difficulties in explaining their formation and origin. Here we propose a novel scenario for the production of planetary systems at such orbits, through the dynamical recapture of free floating planets (FFPs) in dispersing stellar clusters and stellar associations. This process is a natural extension of the recently suggested scenario for the formation of wide stellar binaries. We use N-body simulations of dispersing clusters with 10-1000 stars and comparable numbers of FFPs to study this process. We find that planets are captured into wide orbits in the typical range ~few × 100-106 AU and have a wide range of eccentricities (thermal distribution). Typically, 3-6 × (f FFP/1)% of all stars capture a planetary companion with such properties (where f FFP is the number of FFP per star in the birth clusters). The planetary capture efficiency is comparable to that of capture-formed stellar binaries, and shows a similar dependence on the cluster size and structure. It is almost independent of the specific planetary mass; planets as well as substellar companions of any mass can be captured. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. We also find that more than one planet can be captured around the same host through independent consecutive captures; similarly, planets can be captured into binary systems, both in circumstellar and circumbinary orbits. We also expect planets to be captured into pre-existing planetary (and protoplanetary systems) as well as into orbits around black holes and massive white dwarfs, if these formed early enough before the cluster dispersal. In particular, stellar black holes have a high capture efficiency (>50% and 5-10 × (f FFP/1)% for capture of stars and planetary companions, respectively) due to their large mass. Finally, although rare, two FFPs or brown dwarfs can become bound and form an FFP-binary system with no stellar host.},

	Abstract = {We present the open source Astrophysical Multi-purpose Software Environment (AMUSE), a component library for performing astrophysical simulations involving different physical domains and scales. It couples existing codes within a Python framework based on a communication layer using MPI. The interfaces are standardized for each domain and their implementation based on MPI guarantees that the whole framework is well-suited for distributed computation. It includes facilities for unit handling and data storage. Currently it includes codes for gravitational dynamics, stellar evolution, hydrodynamics and radiative transfer. Within each domain the interfaces to the codes are as similar as possible. We describe the design and implementation of AMUSE, as well as the main components and community codes currently supported and we discuss the code interactions facilitated by the framework. Additionally, we demonstrate how AMUSE can be used to resolve complex astrophysical problems by presenting example applications.  http://www.amusecode.org The current version of the code is available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/557/A84},

	Abstract = {Wide, fragile binary stellar systems are found in the Galactic field, and have recently been noted in the outskirts of expanding star clusters in numerical simulations. Energetically soft, with semimajor axes exceeding the initial size of their birth cluster, it is puzzling how these binaries are created and preserved. We provide an interpretation of the formation of these binaries that explains the total number formed and their distribution of energies. A population of weakly bound binaries can always be found in the cluster, in accordance with statistical detailed balance, limited at the soft end only by the current size of the cluster and whatever observational criteria are imposed. At any given time, the observed soft binary distribution is predominantly a snapshot of a transient population. However, there is a constantly growing population of long-lived soft binaries that are removed from the detailed balance cycle due to the changing density and velocity dispersion of an expanding cluster. The total number of wide binaries that form, and their energy distribution, are insensitive to the cluster population; the number is approximately 1 per cluster. This suggests that a population composed of many dissolved small-N clusters will more efficiently populate the field with wide binaries than that composed of dissolved large-N clusters. Locally such binaries are present at approximately the 2 per cent level; thus the production rate is consistent with the field being populated by clusters with a median of a few hundred stars rather than a few thousand.},

@article{Kouwenhoven:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Over the past few decades, numerous wide (>103 au) binaries in the Galactic field and halo have been discovered. Their existence cannot be explained by the process of star formation or by dynamical interactions in the field, and their origin has long been a mystery. We explain the origin of these wide binaries by formation during the dissolution phase of young star clusters: an initially unbound pair of stars may form a binary when their distance in phase space is small. Using N-body simulations, we find that the resulting wide binary fraction in the semimajor axis range 103au < a < 0.1pc for individual clusters is 1-30 per cent, depending on the initial conditions. The existence of numerous wide binaries in the field is consistent with observational evidence that most clusters start out with a large degree of substructure. The wide binary fraction decreases strongly with increasing cluster mass, and the semimajor axis of the newly formed binaries is determined by the initial cluster size. The resulting eccentricity distribution is thermal, and the mass ratio distribution is consistent with gravitationally focused random pairing. As a large fraction of the stars forms in primordial binaries, we predict that a large number of the observed `wide binaries' are in fact triple or quadruple systems. By integrating over the initial cluster mass distribution, we predict a binary fraction of a few per cent in the semimajor axis range 103au < a < 0.1pc in the Galactic field, which is smaller than the observed wide binary fraction. However, this discrepancy may be solved when we consider a broad range of cluster morphologies.},

	Abstract = {In the first part of this research we extensively investigated and carefully determined osculating, original (when entering Solar system) and future (when leaving it), orbits of 22 near-parabolic comets with small perihelion distance (qosc < 3.1 au), discovered in years 2006-2010. Here, we continue this research with a detailed study of their past and future motion during previous and next orbital periods under the perturbing action of our Galactic environment. At all stages of our dynamical study, we precisely propagate in time the observational uncertainties of cometary orbits. For the first time in our calculations, we fully take into account individual perturbations from all known stars or stellar systems that closely (less than 3.5 pc) approach the Sun during the cometary motion in the investigated time interval of several million years. This is done by means of a direct numerical integration of the N-body system comprising of a comet, the Sun and 90 potential stellar perturbers. We show a full review of various examples of individual stellar action on cometary motion. We conclude that perturbations from all known stars or stellar systems do not change the overall picture of the past orbit evolution of long-period comets. Their future motion might be seriously perturbed during the predicted close approach of Gliese 710 star but we do not observe significant energy changes. The importance of stellar perturbations is tested on the whole sample of 108 comets investigated by us so far and our previous results, obtained with only Galactic perturbations included, are fully confirmed. We present how our results can be used to discriminate between dynamically new and old near-parabolic comets and discuss the relevance of the so-called Jupiter-Saturn barrier phenomenon. Finally, we show how the Oort spike in the 1/a-distribution of near-parabolic comets is built from both dynamically new and old comets. We also point out that C/2007 W1 seems to be the first serious candidate for interstellar provenance.},

@article{Heggie:1975aa,
	Abstract = {Numerical experiments have demonstrated something of the importance of binaries in N-body systems, and this paper aims to provide a comprehensive theoretical picture of their behavior. It begins by testing possible 'equilibrium' distributions for binaries against the results of computational experiments, but is mainly concerned with the dynamics of encounters between binaries and other members of the system. Using an impulsive approximation, it is shown that pairs with low binding energies tend to be disrupted by encounters. The theory for energetic pairs is complicated by the considerably richer variety of possible phenomena, including distant encounters in which changes in eccentricity much exceed changes in energy, and exchange events in which an incoming star may replace one component of the binary. The result of all types of encounter is that energetic pairs tend to become more energetic, at an average rate which is approximately independent of their binding energy.},

	Abstract = {The majority of stars form in star clusters and many are thought to have planetary companions. We demonstrate that multiplanet systems are prone to instabilities as a result of frequent stellar encounters in these star clusters much more than single-planet systems. The cumulative effect of close and distant encounters on these planetary systems are investigated using Monte Carlo scattering experiments. We consider two types of planetary configurations orbiting Sun-like stars: (i) five Jupiter-mass planets in the semimajor axis range 1-42 au orbiting a Solar mass star, with orbits that are initially coplanar, circular and separated by 10 mutual Hill radii and (ii) the four gas giants of our Solar system. We find that in the equal-mass planet model, 70 per cent of the planets with initial semimajor axes a > 40 au are either ejected or have collided with the central star or another planet within the lifetime of a typical cluster, and that more than 50 per cent of all planets with a < 10 au remain bound to the system. Planets with short orbital periods are not directly affected by encountering stars. However, secular evolution of perturbed systems may result in the ejection of the innermost planets or in physical collisions of the innermost planets with the host star, up to many thousands of years after a stellar encounter. The simulations of the Solar system-like systems indicate that Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are affected by both direct interactions with encountering stars, as well as planet-planet scattering. Jupiter, on the other hand, is almost only affected by direct encounters with neighbouring stars, as its mass is too large to be substantially perturbed by the other three planets. Our results indicate that stellar encounters can account for the apparent scarcity of exoplanets in star clusters, not only for those on wide-orbit that are directly affected by stellar encounters, but also planets close to the star which can disappear long after a stellar encounter has perturbed the planetary system.},

	Abstract = {Astrophysical research in recent decades has made significant progress thanks to the availability of various N-body simulation techniques. With the rapid development of high-performance computing technologies, modern simulations have been able to use the computing power of massively parallel clusters with more than 105 GPU cores. While unprecedented accuracy and dynamical scales have been achieved, the enormous amount of data being generated continuously poses great challenges for the subsequent procedures of data analysis and archiving. In this paper, we propose an adaptive storage scheme for simulation data, inspired by the block time step (BTS) integration scheme found in a number of direct N-body integrators available nowadays, as an urgent response to these challenges. The proposed scheme, namely, the BTS storage scheme, works by minimizing the data redundancy by assigning individual output frequencies to the data as required by the researcher. As demonstrated by benchmarks, the proposed scheme is applicable to a wide variety of simulations. Despite the main focus of developing a solution for direct N-body simulation data, the methodology is transferable for grid-based or tree-based simulations where hierarchical time stepping is used.},

	Abstract = {We review the long-term survival chances of young massive star clusters (YMCs), hallmarks of intense starburst episodes often associated with violent galaxy interactions. We address the key question as to whether at least some of these YMCs can be considered proto-globular clusters (GCs), in which case these would be expected to evolve into counterparts of the ubiquitous old GCs believed to be among the oldest galactic building blocks. In the absence of significant external perturbations, the key factor determining a cluster's long-term survival chances is the shape of its stellar initial mass function (IMF). It is, however, not straightforward to assess the IMF shape in unresolved extragalactic YMCs. We discuss in detail the promise of using high-resolution spectroscopy to make progress towards this goal, as well as the numerous pitfalls associated with this approach. We also discuss the latest progress in worldwide efforts to better understand the evolution of entire cluster systems, the disruption processes they are affected by, and whether we can use recently gained insights to determine the nature of at least some of the YMCs observed in extragalactic starbursts as proto-GCs. We conclude that there is an increasing body of evidence that GC formation appears to be continuing until today; their long-term evolution crucially depends on their environmental conditions, however.},

	Abstract = {The absolute magnitude and perihelion distributions of long-period comets are derived, using data from the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) survey. The results are surprising in three ways. First, the flux of comets through the inner solar system is much lower than some previous estimates. Second, the expected rise in comet numbers to larger perihelia is not seen. Third, the number of comets per unit absolute magnitude does not significantly rise to fainter magnitudes. These results imply that the Oort Cloud contains many fewer comets than some previous estimates, that small long-period comets collide with the Earth too infrequently to be a plausible source of Tunguska-style impacts, and that some physical process must have prevented small icy planetesimals from reaching the Oort Cloud, or have rendered them unobservable. A tight limit is placed on the space density of interstellar comets, but the predicted space density is lower still. The number of long-period comets that will be discovered by telescopes such as SkyMapper, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is predicted, and the optimum observing strategy is discussed.},

	Abstract = {During the planet formation process, billions of comets are created and ejected into interstellar space. The detection and characterization of such interstellar comets (ICs) (also known as extra-solar planetesimals or extra-solar comets) would give us in situ information about the efficiency and properties of planet formation throughout the galaxy. However, no ICs have ever been detected, despite the fact that their hyperbolic orbits would make them readily identifiable as unrelated to the solar system. Moro-Mart{\'\i}n et al. have made a detailed and reasonable estimate of the properties of the IC population. We extend their estimates of detectability with a numerical model that allows us to consider ``close'' ICs, e.g., those that come within the orbit of Jupiter. We include several constraints on a ``detectable'' object that allow for realistic estimates of the frequency of detections expected from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and other surveys. The influence of several of the assumed model parameters on the frequency of detections is explored in detail. Based on the expectation from Moro-Mart{\'\i}n et al., we expect that LSST will detect 0.001-10 ICs during its nominal 10 year lifetime, with most of the uncertainty from the unknown number density of small (nuclei of ˜0.1-1 km) ICs. Both asteroid and comet cases are considered, where the latter includes various empirical prescriptions of brightening. Using simulated LSST-like astrometric data, we study the problem of orbit determination for these bodies, finding that LSST could identify their orbits as hyperbolic and determine an ephemeris sufficiently accurate for follow-up in about 4-7 days. We give the hyperbolic orbital parameters of the most detectable ICs. Taking the results into consideration, we give recommendations to future searches for ICs.},

	Abstract = {We derived 90% confidence limits (CLs) on the interstellar number density ({rho }{IS}{CL}) of interstellar objects (ISOs; comets and asteroids) as a function of the slope of their size--frequency distribution (SFD) and limiting absolute magnitude. To account for gravitational focusing, we first generated a quasi-realistic ISO population to ~ 750 {au} from the Sun and propagated it forward in time to generate a steady state population of ISOs with heliocentric distance < 50 {au}. We then simulated the detection of the synthetic ISOs using pointing data for each image and average detection efficiencies for each of three contemporary solar system surveys---Pan-STARRS1, the Mt. Lemmon Survey, and the Catalina Sky Survey. These simulations allowed us to determine the surveys' combined ISO detection efficiency under several different but realistic modes of identifying ISOs in the survey data. Some of the synthetic detected ISOs had eccentricities as small as 1.01, which is in the range of the largest eccentricities of several known comets. Our best CL of {rho }{IS}{CL}=1.4× {10}-4 {{au}}-3 implies that the expectation that extra-solar systems form like our solar system, eject planetesimals in the same way, and then distribute them throughout the Galaxy, is too simplistic, or that the SFD or behavior of ISOs as they pass through our solar system is far from expectation.},

@article{Boyajian:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Over the duration of the Kepler mission, KIC 8462852 was observed to undergo irregularly shaped, aperiodic dips in flux of up to ˜20 per cent. The dipping activity can last for between 5 and 80 d. We characterize the object with high-resolution spectroscopy, spectral energy distribution fitting, radial velocity measurements, high-resolution imaging, and Fourier analyses of the Kepler light curve. We determine that KIC 8462852 is a typical main-sequence F3 V star that exhibits no significant IR excess, and has no very close interacting companions. In this paper, we describe various scenarios to explain the dipping events observed in the Kepler light curve. We confirm that the dipping signals in the data are not caused by any instrumental or data processing artefact, and thus are astrophysical in origin. We construct scenario-independent constraints on the size and location of a body in the system that are needed to reproduce the observations. We deliberate over several assorted stellar and circumstellar astrophysical scenarios, most of which have problems explaining the data in hand. By considering the observational constraints on dust clumps in orbit around a normal main-sequence star, we conclude that the scenario most consistent with the data in hand is the passage of a family of exocomet or planetesimal fragments, all of which are associated with a single previous break-up event, possibly caused by tidal disruption or thermal processing. The minimum total mass associated with these fragments likely exceeds 10-6 M⊕, corresponding to an original rocky body of >100 km in diameter. We discuss the necessity of future observations to help interpret the system.},

@article{Bodman:2016aa,
	Abstract = {We investigate the plausibility of a cometary source of the unusual transits observed in the KIC 8462852 light curve. A single comet of similar size to those in our solar system produces a transit depth of the order of 10-3 lasting less than a day which is much smaller and shorter than the largest dip observed (˜ 20% for ˜3 days), but a large, closely traveling cluster of comets can fit the observed depths and durations. We find that a series of large comet swarms, with all except one on the same orbit, provides a good fit for the KIC 8462852 data during Quarters 16 and 17, but does not explain the large dip observed during Quarter 8. However, the transit dips only loosely constrain the orbits and can be fit by swarms with periastrons differing by a factor of 10. To reach a transit depth of ˜0.2, the comets need to be in a close group of ˜30, if they are ˜100 km in radius or in a group of ˜300 if they are ˜10 km in radius. The total number of comets required to fit all of the dips is ˜70 ˜ 100 km or ˜700 ˜ 10 km comets. A single comet family from a tidally disrupted Ceres-sized progenitor or the start of a Late Heavy Bombardment period explains the last ˜60 days of the unusual KIC 8462852 light curve.},

@article{Levison:1994aa,
	Abstract = {We have developed and tested a computer code to follow the long-term dynamical evolution of a swarm of test particles in the solar system. The technique effciently and accurately handles close approaches between test particles and planets while retaining the powerful features of recently developed mixed variable symplectic integrators. We use the code to numerically integrate the orbits of the known short-period comets under the influence of the Sun and all planets except Mercury and Pluto, for times up to 107 years. It is found under a classification based on period that most comets move between Jupiter-family and Halley-family orbits many times in their dynamical lifetimes. We adopt a classification that defines Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) as comets with T greater than 2 and Halley-family comets (HFCs) as those with T less than 2. In this scheme, less than 8% of comets change families during the integration and most of those that change tend to remain near the Tisserand dividing line throughout. Thus, the JFCs are dynamically distinct from the HFCs. We find that in our forward integration, 92% of comets are ejected from the solar system, and that approximately 6% are destroyed by becoming sun-grazers. The number of sun-grazers is far more than would be expected from the existing analytic theories. The median lifetime of all known short-period comets from the current time to ultimate destruction or ejection is approximately 4.5 x 105 years. The very flat inclination distribution of (JFCs) found to become more distended as it ages. Since JFCs are dynamically distinct from HFCs, they must have an inclination distribution, when they first become visible, that is even flatter than that currently observed. For reasonable values of the physical lifetime before fading, we calculate that there should be roughly 5-20 times as many extinct JFCs as currently known JFCs.},

	Abstract = {We present the first study to synthesize results from five different exoplanet surveys using three independent detection methods: microlensing, radial velocity, and direct imaging. The constraints derived herein represent the most comprehensive picture of the demographics of large-separation (≳2 AU) planets orbiting the most common stars in our Galaxy that has been constructed to date. We assume a simple, joint power-law planet distribution function of the form {d}2{N}{{pl}}/(d{log} {m}p d{log} a)={ A }{({m}p/{M}{{Sat}})}alpha {(a/2.5{{AU}})}beta  with an outer cutoff radius of the separation distribution function of aout. Generating populations of planets from these models and mapping them into the relevant observables for each survey, we use actual or estimated detection sensitivities to determine the expected observations for each survey. Comparing with the reported results, we derive constraints on the parameters \{alpha ,beta ,{ A },{a}{{out}}\} that describe a single population of planets that is simultaneously consistent with the results of microlensing, radial velocity, and direct imaging surveys. We find median and 68% confindence intervals of alpha =-{0.86}-0.19+0.21 (-{0.85}-0.19+0.21), beta ={1.1}-1.4+1.9 ({1.1}-1.3+1.9), { A }={0.21}-0.15+0.20 {{dex}}-2 ({0.21}-0.15+0.20 {{dex}}-2), and {a}{{out}}={10}-4.7+26 AU ({12}-6.2+50 AU) assuming ``hot-start'' (``cold-start'') planet evolutionary models. These values are consistent with all current knowledge of planets on orbits beyond ~2 AU around single M dwarfs.},

	Abstract = {The importance of comets for the origin of life on Earth has been advocated  for many decades. Amino acids are key ingredients in chemistry, leading to  life as we know it. Many primitive meteorites contain amino acids, and it is  generally believed that these are formed by aqueous alterations. In the  collector aerogel and foil samples of the Stardust mission after the flyby  at comet Wild 2, the simplest form of amino acids, glycine, has been found  together with precursor molecules methylamine and ethylamine. Because of  contamination issues of the samples, a cometary origin was deduced from  the 13C isotopic signature. We report the presence of volatile glycine  accompanied by methylamine and ethylamine in the coma of  67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko measured by the ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter  Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis) mass spectrometer, confirming  the Stardust results. Together with the detection of phosphorus and a  multitude of organic molecules, this result demonstrates that comets  could have played a crucial role in the emergence of life on Earth.},

@article{Preston:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Terrestrial analogue studies underpin almost all planetary missions and their use is essential in the exploration of our Solar system and in assessing the habitability of other worlds. Their value relies on the similarity of the analogue to its target, either in terms of their mineralogical or geochemical context, or current physical or chemical environmental conditions. Such analogue sites offer critical ground-truthing for astrobiological studies on the habitability of different environmental parameter sets, the biological mechanisms for survival in extreme environments and the preservation potential and detectability of biosignatures. The 33 analogue sites discussed in this review have been selected on the basis of their congruence to particular extraterrestrial locations. Terrestrial field sites that have been used most often in the literature, as well as some lesser known ones which require greater study, are incorporated to inform on the astrobiological potential of Venus, Mars, Europa, Enceladus and Titan. For example, the possibility of an aerial habitable zone on Venus has been hypothesized based on studies of life at high-altitudes in the terrestrial atmosphere. We also demonstrate why many different terrestrial analogue sites are required to satisfactorily assess the habitability of the changing environmental conditions throughout Martian history, and recommend particular sites for different epochs or potential niches. Finally, habitable zones within the aqueous environments of the icy moons of Europa and Enceladus and potentially in the hydrocarbon lakes of Titan are discussed and suitable analogue sites proposed. It is clear from this review that a number of terrestrial analogue sites can be applied to multiple planetary bodies, thereby increasing their value for astrobiological exploration. For each analogue site considered here, we summarize the pertinent physiochemical environmental features they offer and critically assess the fidelity with which they emulate their intended target locale. We also outline key issues associated with the existing documentation of analogue research and the constraints this has on the efficiency of discoveries in this field. This review thus highlights the need for a global open access database for planetary analogues.},

	Abstract = {Stromatolites document microbial interactions with sediments and flowing water throughout recorded Earth history and have the potential to illuminate the long-term history of life and environments. Modern stromatolites, however, provide analogs to only a small subset of the structures preserved in Archean and Proterozoic carbonates. Thus, interpretations of secular trends in the shapes and textures of ancient columnar stromatolites require nonuniformitarian, scale-dependent models of microbial responses to nutrient availability, seawater chemistry, influx of sediment grains, shear, and burial. Models that integrate stromatolite scales, macroscopic organization, and shapes could also help test the biogenicity of the oldest stromatolites and other structures whose petrographic fabrics do not preserve direct evidence of microbial activity. An improved understanding of stromatolite morphogenesis in the presence of oxygenic and anoxygenic microbial mats may illuminate the diversity of microbial metabolisms that contributed to stromatolite growth in early oceans.},

	Abstract = {The solar system started to form about 4.56 Gyr ago and despite the long intervening time span, there still exist several clues about its formation. The three major sources for this information are meteorites, the present solar system structure and the planet-forming systems around young stars. In this introduction we give an overview of the current understanding of the solar system formation from all these different research fields. This includes the question of the lifetime of the solar protoplanetary disc, the different stages of planet formation, their duration, and their relative importance. We consider whether meteorite evidence and observations of protoplanetary discs point in the same direction. This will tell us whether our solar system had a typical formation history or an exceptional one. There are also many indications that the solar system formed as part of a star cluster. Here we examine the types of cluster the Sun could have formed in, especially whether its stellar density was at any stage high enough to influence the properties of today's solar system. The likelihood of identifying siblings of the Sun is discussed. Finally, the possible dynamical evolution of the solar system since its formation and its future are considered.},

The thousands of known exoplanets and planet candidates are extremely diverse in terms of their masses or sizes, orbits, and host star type. The diversity extends to new kinds of planets, which are very common yet have no solar system counterparts. Even with the requirement that a planet's surface temperature must be compatible with liquid water (because all life on Earth requires liquid water), a new emerging view is that planets very different from Earth may have the right conditions for life. The broadened possibilities will increase the future chances of discovering an inhabited world.},

	Abstract = {We have performed N-body simulations of tidally filling star clusters with a range of orbits in a Milky Way-like potential to study the effects of orbital inclination and eccentricity on their structure and evolution. At small galactocentric distances Rgc, a non-zero inclination results in increased mass-loss rates. Tidal heating and disc shocking, the latter sometimes consisting of two shocking events as the cluster moves towards and away from the disc, help remove stars from the cluster. Clusters with inclined orbits at large Rgc have decreased mass-loss rates than the non-inclined case, since the strength of the disc potential decreases with Rgc. Clusters with inclined and eccentric orbits experience increased tidal heating due to a constantly changing potential, weaker disc shocks since passages occur at higher Rgc, and an additional tidal shock at perigalacticon. The effects of orbital inclination decrease with orbital eccentricity, as a highly eccentric cluster spends the majority of its lifetime at a large Rgc. The limiting radii of clusters with inclined orbits are best represented by the rt of the cluster when at its maximum height above the disc, where the cluster spends the majority of its lifetime and the rate of change in rt is a minimum. Conversely, the effective radius is independent of inclination in all cases.},

	Abstract = {Most planetary systems are formed within stellar clusters, and these environments can shape their properties. This paper considers scattering encounters between solar systems and passing cluster members, and calculates the corresponding interaction cross-sections. The target solar systems are generally assumed to have four giant planets, with a variety of starting states, including circular orbits with the semimajor axes of our planets, a more compact configuration, an ultracompact state with multiple mean motion resonances, and systems with massive planets. We then consider the effects of varying the cluster velocity dispersion, the relative importance of binaries versus single stars, different stellar host masses, and finite starting eccentricities of the planetary orbits. For each state of the initial system, we perform an ensemble of numerical scattering experiments and determine the cross-sections for eccentricity increase, inclination angle increase, planet ejection, and capture. This paper reports results from over 2 million individual scattering simulations. Using supporting analytic considerations, and fitting functions to the numerical results, we find a universal formula that gives the cross-sections as a function of stellar host mass, cluster velocity dispersion, starting planetary orbital radius, and final eccentricity. The resulting cross-sections can be used in a wide variety of applications. As one example, we revisit constraints on the birth aggregate of our Solar system due to dynamical scattering and find N ≲ 104 (consistent with previous estimates).},

	Abstract = {We analyze a sample of 73 old long-period comets (LPCs) (orbital periods $200 < P < 1000$ yr) with perihelion distances $q < 2.5$ au, discovered in the period 1850-2014. We cloned the observed comets and also added fictitious LPCs with perihelia in the Jupiter's zone. We consider both a purely dynamical evolution and a physico-dynamical one with different physical lifetimes. We can fit the computed energy distribution of comets with $q < 1.3$ au to the observed one only within the energy range $0.01 < x < 0.04$ au$^{-1}$ (or periods $125 < P < 1000$ yr), where the "energy" is taken as the inverse of the semimajor axis $a$, namely $x \equiv 1/a$. The best results are obtained for physical lifetimes of about 200-300 revolutions (for a comet with a standard $q = 1$ au). We find that neither a purely dynamical evolution, nor a physico-dynamical one can reproduce the long tail of larger binding energies ($x \gsim 0.04$ au$^{-1}$) that correspond to most Halley-type comets (HTCs) and Jupiter-family comets. We conclude that most HTCs are not the end states of the evolution of LPCs, but come from a different source, a flattened one that we identify with the Centaurs that are scattered to the inner planetary region from the trans-Neptunian belt. These results also show that the boundary between LPCs and HTCs should be located at an energy $x \sim 0.04$ au$^{-1}$ ($P \sim 125$ yr), rather than the conventional classical boundary at $P = 200$ yr.},

	Abstract = {Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can speed up the numerical solution of various problems in astrophysics including the dynamical evolution of stellar systems; the performance gain can be more than a factor 100 compared to using a Central Processing Unit only. In this work I describe some strategies to speed up the classical $N$-body problem using GPUs. I show some features of the $N$-body code HiGPUs as template code. In this context, I also give some hints on the parallel implementation of a regularization method and I introduce the code HiGPUs-R. Although the main application of this work concerns astrophysics, some of the presented techniques are of general validity and can be applied to other branches of physics such as electrodynamics and QCD.},

@article{Morbidelli:2004aa,
	Abstract = {We revisit the scenario proposed by Duncan and Levison in the late 1990s on the origin of the trans-Neptunian scattered disc. According to this scenario, the current scattered disc population is the remnant of a much more massive population that formed at the beginning of the Solar system, presumably when Neptune grew in mass. In order to compute the expected orbital distribution of the scattered disc bodies in the framework of this model, we have integrated the evolution of several thousands of test particles over the age of the Solar system, and looked at the orbital distribution of those surviving after more than 2 × 109 yr from their first scattering event. In order to compare this model distribution with the observed distribution, we have modelled the observational biases by generalizing a method originally introduced recently by Trujillo and Brown. Once the biases are taken into account, the model distribution matches the observed distribution fairly well. The most significant discrepancy is that the observed perihelion distance distribution is somewhat skewed towards larger perihelion distances than our model predicts. This is possibly due to the effects of planet migration (which tends to raise perihelion distances as recently shown by Gomes), which is not taken into account in our simulations.},

	Abstract = {It is generally assumed that the solar system is surrounded by a swarm of comets, the so-called Oort Cloud, which contains approximately 10 to the 11th members. The observed comets belong to a small subsection of the Cloud, and they have very elongated orbits. The origin of the Cloud is presently unclear. Here the possibility that the comets were born in a star cluster together with the sun is considered, following the evolution of the star cluster with its embedded swarm of comets and calculating the rate at which stars accumulate stable comet companions. It is concluded that, if the Oort Cloud was born in this process, then the present-day density of comets in interstellar space has to be high, and comets make a significant contribution to the overall mass density of the Galaxy.},

@article{Tsiganis:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Planetary formation theories suggest that the giant planets formed on circular and coplanar orbits. The eccentricities of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, however, reach values of 6 per cent, 9 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively. In addition, the inclinations of the orbital planes of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune take maximum values of ~2 degrees with respect to the mean orbital plane of Jupiter. Existing models for the excitation of the eccentricity of extrasolar giant planets have not been successfully applied to the Solar System. Here we show that a planetary system with initial quasi-circular, coplanar orbits would have evolved to the current orbital configuration, provided that Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 orbital resonance. We show that this resonance crossing could have occurred as the giant planets migrated owing to their interaction with a disk of planetesimals. Our model reproduces all the important characteristics of the giant planets' orbits, namely their final semimajor axes, eccentricities and mutual inclinations.},

@article{Thommes:1999aa,
	Abstract = {Planets are believed to have formed through the accumulation of a large number of small bodies. In the case of the gas-giant planets Jupiter and Saturn, they accreted a significant amount of gas directly from the protosolar nebula after accumulating solid cores of about 5-15 Earth masses. Such models, however, have been unable to produce the smaller ice giants Uranus and Neptune at their present locations, because in that region of the Solar System the small planetary bodies will have been more widely spaced, and less tightly bound gravitationally to the Sun. When applied to the current Jupiter-Saturn zone, a recent theory predicts that, in addition to the solid cores of Jupiter and Saturn, two or three other solid bodies of comparable mass are likely to have formed. Here we report the results of model calculations that demonstrate that such cores will have been gravitationally scattered outwards as Jupiter, and perhaps Saturn, accreted nebular gas. The orbits of these cores then evolve into orbits that resemble those of Uranus and Neptune, as a result of gravitational interactions with the small bodies in the outer disk of the protosolar nebula.},

@article{Malhotra:1995aa,
	Abstract = {The origin of the highly eccentric, inclined, and resonance-locked orbit of Pluto has long been a puzzle. A possible explanation has been proposed recently [Malhotra, 1993, Nature, 365, 819] which suggests that these extraordinary orbital properties may be a natural consequence of the formation and early dynamical evolution of the outer solar system. A resonance capture mechanism is possible during the clearing of the residual planetesimal debris and the formation of the Oort Cloud of comets by planetesimal mass loss from the vicinity of the giant planets.  If this mechanism were in operation during the early history of the planetary system, the entire region between the orbit of Neptune and approximately 50 AU would have been swept by first-order mean motion resonances. Thus, resonance capture could occur not only for Pluto, but quite generally for other trans-Neptunian small bodies. Some consequences of this evolution for the present-day dynamical structure of the trans-Neptunian region are (i) most of the objects in the region beyond Neptune and up to ˜50 AU exist in very narrow zones located at orbital resonances with Neptune (particularly the 3:2 and the 2:1 resonances); and (ii) these resonant objects would have significantly large eccentricities. The distribution of objects in the Kuiper Belt as predicted by this theory is presented here.},

@article{Paulech:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Aims: The Oort cloud consists of cometary nuclei which were ejected from the once existing proto-planetary disc to large heliocentric distances by the giant planets. The process of the cloud formation depended on the initial structure and mass of the disc. Considering four models of an initial proto-planetary disc, we roughly probe this dependence.  Methods: We use the resultant data of our previous simulation of the Oort cloud formation for the first two Gyr. The considered disc models consist of a set of representative test particles. The new models are created subtracting a fraction of the particles from the model considered in our previous work, in a way to obtain the required heliocentric-distance distribution. Specifically, we focus on the situations in which a part of the small bodies in the disc is assumed to be already spent in the previous process of the giant planet formation. We omit the particles from an originally smooth profile in the regions adjacent to the planet orbits. With the reduced data, we construct the comet cloud characteristics we are interested in.  Results: We find that it is difficult to construct the proto-planetary disc if (i) the amount of heavy chemical elements in Jupiter and Saturn is as high as currently accepted (≈ 20 and ≈ 29 Moplus; respectively) and (ii) the total mass of the minimum-mass solar nebula is assumed to be lower than ≈ 0.05 M&sun;. The behaviour of the Oort cloud formation does not crucially depend on the initial disc model. Some quantitative differences in its structure are obvious: since the cloud is known to be filled mainly by Uranus and Neptune, the efficiency of its formation is higher if the initial amount of particles in the Uranus-Neptune region is relatively higher. The efficiency is also higher in the gapped-disc models because a less amount of particles experience a very close encounter with a planet resulting in their ejection into the interstellar space.},

	Abstract = {We present Mercury: a new general-purpose software package for carrying out orbital integrations for problems in solar-system dynamics. Suitable applications include studying the long-term stability of the planetary system, investigating the orbital evolution of comets, asteroids or meteoroids, and simulating planetary accretion. Mercury is designed to be versatile and easy to use, accepting initial conditions in either Cartesian coordinates or Keplerian elements in ``cometary'' or ``asteroidal'' format, with different epochs of osculation for different objects. Output from an integration consists of either osculating or averaged (``proper'') elements, written in a machine-independent compressed format, which allows the results of a calculation performed on one platform to be transferred (e.g. via FTP) and decoded on another. Mercury itself is platform independent, and can be run on machines using DEC Unix, Open VMS, HP Unix, Solaris, Linux or DOS. During an integration, Mercury monitors and records details of close encounters, sungrazing events, ejections and collisions between objects. The effects of non-gravitational forces on comets can also be modelled. Additional effects such as Poynting-Robertson drag, post-Newtonian corrections, oblateness of the primary, and the galactic potential will be incorporated in future. The package currently supports integrations using a mixed-variable symplectic routine, the Bulirsch-Stoer method, and a hybrid code for planetary accretion calculations; with Everhart's popular RADAU algorithm and a symmetric multistep routine to be added shortly. Our presentation will include a demonstration of the latest version of Mercury, with the explicit aim of getting feedback from potential users and incorporating these suggestions into a final version that will be made available to everybody.},

	Abstract = {We investigate how the formation and evolution of extrasolar planetary systems can be affected by stellar encounters that occur in the crowded conditions of a stellar cluster. Using plausible estimates of cluster evolution, we show how planet formation may be suppressed in globular clusters while planets wider than >~0.1au that do form in such environments can be ejected from their stellar system. Less crowded systems such as open clusters have a much reduced effect on any planetary system. Planet formation is unaffected in open clusters and only the wider planetary systems will be disrupted during the cluster's lifetime. The potential for free-floating planets in these environments is also discussed.},

@article{Kobayashi:2001aa,
	Abstract = {We investigate the effects of a passing stellar encounter on a planetesimal disk through analytical calculations and numerical simulations, and derive the boundary radius ( aplanet) outside which planet formation is inhibited by disruptive collisions with high relative velocities. S. Ida, J. Larwood, and A. Burkert (2000, Astrophys. J. 528, 1013-1025) suggested that a stellar encounter caused inhibition of planet formation in the outer part of a protoplanetary disk. We study orbital eccentricity ( e) and inclination ( i) of planetesimals pumped up by perturbations of a passing single star. We also study the degree of alignment of longitude of pericenter and ascending node to estimate relative velocities between the planetesimals. We model a protoplanetary system as a disk of massless particles circularly orbiting a host star, following S. Ida, J. Laywood, and A. Burkert (2000, Astrophys. J.528, 1013-1025). The massless particles represent planetesimals. A single star as massive as the host star encounters the protoplanetary system. Numerical orbital simulations show that in the inner region at semimajor axis a≲0.2 D where D is the pericenter distance of the encounter, e and i have power-law dependence on ( a/ D) as e∝( a/ D) 5/2 and i∝( a/ D) 3/2, and the longitudes are aligned, independent of the encounter parameters. In the outer region a≳0.2 D, and the radial gradient is steeper and is not expressed by a single power law. The longitudes are not aligned. Since planet accretion is inhibited by e as small as 0.01, we focus on the weakly perturbed inner region. We analytically reproduce the power-law dependence and explicitly give numerical factors of the power-law dependence as functions of encounter parameters. We derive the boundar y radius ( aplanet) of the planet-forming region as a function of dynamical parameters of a stellar cluster, assuming the protoplanetary system belongs to the stellar cluster. The radial gradient of e is so steep that the boundary is sharply determined. Planetesimal orbits are significantly modified beyond the boundary, while they are almost intact inside the boundary. This tendency is strengthened by reduction of relative velocity due to the longitude alignment in the inner region. We find aplanet ˜ 40-60 AU in the case of D ˜ 150-200 AU. D ˜ 200 AU may be likely to occur in a relatively dense cluster. We point out that the size of planetary systems ( aplanet) born in a dense cluster may be necessarily restricted to that comparable to the size of a planet region (˜30-40 AU) of our SolarSystem.},

	Abstract = {The nearby main-sequence star beta Pictoris is surrounded by an edge-on disk of dust produced by the collisional erosion of larger planetesimals. Here we report the discovery of substructure within the northeast extension of the disk midplane that may represent an asymmetric ring system around beta Pic. We present a dynamical model showing that a close stellar flyby with a quiescent disk of planetesimals can create such rings, along with previously unexplained disk asymmetries. Thus we infer that beta Pic's planetesimal disk was highly disrupted by a stellar encounter in the last hundred thousand years.},

	Abstract = {We consider the deformation that has recently been observed in the inner part of the circumstellar disk around Beta Pictoris with the HST. Our recent ground-based, adaptive optics coronagraphic observations confirm that the inner disk is warped. We investigate the hypothesis that a yet undetected planet is responsible for the observed warp, through simulations of the effect of the gravitational perturbation resulting from a massive companion on the disk. The physical processes assumed in the simulations are discussed: since the observed particles do not survive collisions, the apparent disk shape is driven by the underlying collisionless parent population. The resulting possible parameters for the planet that are consistent with the observed disk deformation are reviewed.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we revisit the problem of the tidal interaction occurring between a protostellar accretion disc and a secondary point mass following a parabolic trajectory. We model the disc response analytically and we compare our results with three-dimensional SPH simulations. Inviscid as well as viscous hydrodynamics is considered. We show that in a viscous system the response derived from inviscid considerations is predominant even for the highest estimates of an anomalous disc shear viscosity. The angular momentum lost from the disc during the encounter is derived from linear theory for distant fly-bys. It is shown that the target discs can become warped and precess by a small amount during non-coplanar encounters. This small precession is shown to give rise to a relative tilt of the disc which is always more important for determining its final orientation than is the change to the orbital inclination. We discuss the implications of our results for protostellar accretion discs and planetary systems.},

@article{Malmberg:2007aa,
	Abstract = {The stars that populate the solar neighbourhood were formed in stellar clusters. Through N-body simulations of these clusters, we measure the rate of close encounters between stars. By monitoring the interaction histories of each star, we investigate the singleton fraction in the solar neighbourhood. A singleton is a star which formed as a single star, has never experienced any close encounters with other stars or binaries, or undergone an exchange encounter with a binary. We find that, of the stars which formed as single stars, a significant fraction is not singletons once the clusters have dispersed. If some of these stars had planetary systems, with properties similar to those of the Solar System, the planets' orbits may have been perturbed by the effects of close encounters with other stars or the effects of a companion star within a binary. Such perturbations can lead to strong planet-planet interactions which eject several planets, leaving the remaining planets on eccentric orbits. Some of the single stars exchange into binaries. Most of these binaries are broken up via subsequent interactions within the cluster, but some remain intact beyond the lifetime of the cluster. The properties of these binaries are similar to those of the observed binary systems containing extrasolar planets. Thus, dynamical processes in young stellar clusters will alter significantly any population of Solar System-like planetary systems. In addition, beginning with a population of planetary systems exactly resembling the Solar System around single stars, dynamical encounters in young stellar clusters may produce at least some of the extrasolar planetary systems observed in the solar neighbourhood.},

	Abstract = {The Kuiper belt extends from the orbit of Neptune at 30 AU to an abrupt outer edge about 50 AU from the Sun. Beyond the edge is a sparse population of objects with large orbital eccentricities. Neptune shapes the dynamics of most Kuiper belt objects, but the recently discovered planet 2003 VB12 (Sedna) has an eccentric orbit with a perihelion distance of 70 AU, far beyond Neptune's gravitational influence. Although influences from passing stars could have created the Kuiper belt's outer edge and could have scattered objects into large, eccentric orbits, no model currently explains the properties of Sedna. Here we show that a passing star probably scattered Sedna from the Kuiper belt into its observed orbit. The likelihood that a planet at 60-80 AU can be scattered into Sedna's orbit is about 50 per cent; this estimate depends critically on the geometry of the fly-by. Even more interesting is the ~10 per cent chance that Sedna was captured from the outer disk of the passing star. Most captures have very high inclination orbits; detection of such objects would confirm the presence of extrasolar planets in our own Solar System.},

@article{Di-Stefano:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Short-duration lensing events tend to be generated by low-mass lenses or by lenses with high transverse velocities. Furthermore, for any given lens mass and speed, events of short duration are preferentially caused by nearby lenses (mesolenses) that can be studied in detail, or else by lenses so close to the source star that finite-source-size effects may be detected, yielding information about both the Einstein ring radius and the surface of the lensed star. Planets causing short-duration events may be in orbits with any orientation, and may have semimajor axes smaller than 1 AU, or they may reach the outer limits of their planetary systems, in the region corresponding to the solar system's Oort Cloud. They can have masses larger than Jupiter's or smaller than Pluto's. Lensing therefore has a unique potential to expand our understanding of planetary systems. A particular advantage of lensing is that it can provide precision measurements of system parameters, including the masses of and projected separation between star and planet. We demonstrate how the parameters can be extracted and show that a great deal can be learned. For example, it is remarkable that the gravitational mass of nearby free-floating planet-mass lenses can be measured by complementing observations of a photometric event with deep images that detect the planet itself. A fraction of short events may be caused by high-velocity stars located within a kiloparsec. Many high-velocity lenses are likely to be neutron stars that received large natal kicks. Other high-speed stars may be members of the halo population. Still others may be hypervelocity stars that have been ejected from the Galactic center, or runaway stars escaped from close binaries, possibly including the progenitor binaries of Type Ia supernovae.},

	Abstract = {The chance that a planetary system will interact with another member of its host star's nascent cluster would be greatly increased if gas giant planets form in situ on wide orbits. In this paper, we explore the outcomes of planet-planet scattering for a distribution of multi-planet systems that all have one of the planets on an initial orbit of 100 AU. The scattering experiments are run with and without stellar flybys. We convolve the outcomes with distributions for protoplanetary disk and stellar cluster sizes to generalize the results where possible. We find that the frequencies of large mutual inclinations and high eccentricities are sensitive to the number of planets in a system, but not strongly to stellar flybys. However, flybys do play a role in changing the low and moderate portions of the mutual inclination distributions, and erase dynamically cold initial conditions on average. Wide-orbit planets can be mixed throughout the planetary system, and in some cases, can potentially become hot Jupiters, which we demonstrate using scattering experiments that include a tidal damping model. If planets form in situ on wide orbits, then there will be discernible differences in the proper-motion distributions of a sample of wide-orbit planets compared with a pure scattering formation mechanism. Stellar flybys can enhance the frequency of ejections in planetary systems, but autoionization is likely to remain the dominant source of free-floating planets.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe the architecture and performance of the GRAPE-4 system, a massively parallel special-purpose computer for N-body simulation of gravitational collisional systems. The calculation cost of N-body simulation of collisional self-gravitating system is O(N3). Thus, even with present-day supercomputers, the number of particles one can handle is still around 10,000. In N-body simulations, almost all computing time is spent calculating the force between particles, since the number of interactions is proportional to the square of the number of particles. Computational cost of the rest of the simulation, such as the time integration and the reduction of the result, is generally proportional to the number of particles. The calculation of the force between particles can be greatly accelerated by means of a dedicated special-purpose hardware. We have developed a series of hardware systems, the GRAPE (GRAvity PipE) systems, which perform the force calculation. They are used with a general-purpose host computer which performs the rest of the calculation. The GRAPE-4 system is our newest hardware, completed in 1995 summer. Its peak speed is 1.08 TFLOPS. This speed is achieved by running 1692 pipeline large-scale integrated circuits (LSIs), each providing 640 MFLOPS, in parallel.},

	Abstract = {A systolic algorithm rhythmically computes and passes data through a network of processors. We investigate the performance of systolic algorithms for implementing the gravitational /N-body problem on distributed-memory computers. Systolic algorithms minimize memory requirements by distributing the particles between processors. We show that the performance of systolic routines can be greatly enhanced by the use of non-blocking communication, which allows particle coordinates to be communicated at the same time that force calculations are being carried out. The performance enhancement is particularly great when block sizes are small, i.e., when only a small fraction of the /N particles need their forces computed in each time step. Hyper-systolic algorithms reduce the communication complexity from /O(Np), with /p the processor number, to /O(Nsqrt(p)), at the expense of increased memory demands. We describe a hyper-systolic algorithm that will work with a block time step algorithm and analyze its performance. As an example of an application requiring large /N, we use the systolic algorithm to carry out direct-summation simulations using 106 particles of the Brownian motion of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.},

Other methods means here approximate physical models based on the Fokker-Planck equation as well as other, approximate algorithms to compute the gravitational potential in N-body systems. Questions regarding the parallel implementation of direct ``brute force'' N-body codes are discussed. The astrophysical application of the models to the theory of relaxing rotating and non-rotating collisional star clusters is presented, briefly mentioning the questions of the validity of the Fokker-Planck approximation, the existence of gravothermal oscillations and of rotation and primordial binaries.},

@article{Aarseth:1999aa,
	Abstract = {I review the development of direct N-body codes at Cambridge over nearly 40 years, highlighting the main stepping stones. The first code (NBODY1) was based on the simple concepts of a force polynomial combined with individual time steps, where numerical problems due to close encounters were avoided by a softened potential. Fortuitously, the elegant Kustaanheimo-Stiefel two-body regularization soon permitted small star clusters to be studied (NBODY3). Subsequent extensions to unperturbed three-body and four-body regularization proved beneficial in dealing with multiple interactions. Investigations of larger systems became possible with the Ahmad-Cohen neighbor scheme which was used more than 20 years ago for expanding universe models of 4000 galaxies (NBODY2). Combining the neighbor scheme with the regularization procedures enabled more realistic star clusters to be considered (NBODY5). After a period of simulations with no apparent technical progress, chain regularization replaced the treatment of compact subsystems (NBODY3, NBODY5). More recently, the Hermite integration method provided a major advance and has been implemented on the special-purpose HARP computers (NBODY4) together with an alternative version for workstations and supercomputers (NBODY6). These codes also include a variety of algorithms for stellar evolution based on fast lookup functions. The treatment of primordial binaries contains efficient procedures for chaotic two-body motion as well as tidal circularization, and special attention is paid to hierarchical systems and their stability. This family of N-body codes constitutes a powerful tool for dynamical simulations which is freely available to the astronomical community, and the massive effort owes much to collaborators.},

Instead, we have to observe and analyze the experiments that are ongoing in the Universe. The most telling observations of black holes and neutron stars come from dense stellar systems, where stars are crowded close enough to each other to undergo frequent interactions. It is the interplay between black holes, neutron stars and other objects in a dense environment that allows us to use observations to draw firm conclusions about the properties of these extreme forms of matter, through comparisons with simulations.

	Abstract = {We present a simple analytical description of the disruption of star clusters in a tidal field. The cluster disruption time, defined as t_dis= {d ln  M/dt}-1, depends on the mass M of the cluster as t_dis=t_0(M/M&sun;)gamma with gamma=0.62 for clusters in a tidal field, as shown by empirical studies of cluster samples in different galaxies and by N-body simulations. Using this simple description we derive an analytic expression for the way in which the mass of a cluster decreases with time due to stellar evolution and disruption. The result agrees very well with those of detailed N-body simulations for clusters in the tidal field of our galaxy. The analytic expression can be used to predict the mass and age histograms of surviving clusters for any cluster initial mass function and any cluster formation history. The method is applied to explain the age distribution of the open clusters in the solar neighbourhood within 600 pc, based on a new cluster sample that appears to be unbiased within a distance of about 1 kpc. From a comparison between the observed and predicted age distributions in the age range between 10 Myr to 3 Gyr we find the following results: (1) The disruption time of a 104 M&sun; cluster in the solar neighbourhood is about 1.3 $\pm$ 0.5 Gyr. This is a factor of 5 shorter than that derived from N-body simulations of clusters in the tidal field of the galaxy. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. (2) The present star formation rate in bound clusters within 600 pc of the Sun is 5.9 $\pm$ 0.8 × 102 M&sun; Myr-1, which corresponds to a surface star formation rate of bound clusters of 5.2 $\pm$ 0.7 × 10-10 M&sun; yr-1 pc-2. (3) The age distribution of open clusters shows a bump between 0.26 and 0.6 Gyr when the cluster formation rate was 2.5 times higher than before and after. (4) The present star formation rate in bound clusters is about half that derived from the study of embedded clusters. The difference suggests that about half of the clusters in the solar neighbourhood become unbound within about 10 Myr. (5) The most massive clusters within 600 pc had an initial mass of about 3× 104 M&sun;. This is in agreement with the statistically expected value based on a cluster initial mass function with a slope of -2, even if the physical upper mass limit for cluster formation is as high as 106 M&sun;.},

@article{Dukes:2012aa,
	Abstract = {A number of authors have argued that the Sun must have been born in a cluster of no more than several thousand stars, on the basis that, in a larger cluster, close encounters between the Sun and other stars would have truncated the outer solar system or excited the outer planets into eccentric orbits. However, this dynamical limit is in tension with meteoritic evidence that the solar system was exposed to a nearby supernova during or shortly after its formation; a several-thousand-star cluster is much too small to produce a massive star whose lifetime is short enough to have provided the enrichment. In this paper, we revisit the dynamical limit in the light of improved observations of the properties of young clusters. We use a series of scattering simulations to measure the velocity-dependent cross-section for disruption of the outer solar system by stellar encounters, and use this cross-section to compute the probability of a disruptive encounter as a function of birth cluster properties. We find that, contrary to prior work, the probability of disruption is small regardless of the cluster mass, and that it actually decreases rather than increases with cluster mass. Our results differ from prior work for three main reasons: (1) unlike in most previous work, we compute a velocity-dependent cross-section and properly integrate over the cluster mass-dependent velocity distribution of incoming stars; (2) we recognize that ~90% of clusters have lifetimes of a few crossing times, rather than the 10-100 Myr adopted in many earlier models; and (3) following recent observations, we adopt a mass-independent surface density for embedded clusters, rather than a mass-independent radius as assumed many earlier papers. Our results remove the tension between the dynamical limit and the meteoritic evidence, and suggest that the Sun was born in a massive cluster. A corollary to this result is that close encounters in the Sun's birth cluster are highly unlikely to truncate the Kuiper Belt unless the Sun was born in one of the unusual clusters that survived for tens of Myr. However, we find that encounters could plausibly produce highly eccentric Kuiper Belt objects such as Sedna.},

	Abstract = {We present numerical orbital integrations of thousands of massless particles as they evolve from Neptune-encountering orbits in the Kuiper belt for up to 1 Gyr or until they either impact a massive body or are ejected from the Solar System. The median dynamical lifetime of these objects is 4.5 × 10 7years. We found that about 30% of these objects became visible comets. (We refer to a comet with perihelion distance <2.5 AU as a "visible" comet.) Of those, 99.7% were Jupiter-family comets (as defined by their Tisserand parameter, hereafter "JFCs") when they first became visible, although some evolved out of the Jupiter family as time progressed. By comparing the observed orbital element distribution of JFCs to that produced by our simulations we deduce that JFCs are statistically most likely to have physical lifetimes of ˜12,000 years. Based on this estimate of physical lifetimes and the fact that there are ˜110 active, visible JFCs with HT< 9, we conclude that there are currently ˜1.2 × 10 7ecliptic comets (those with T> 2), of sizes consistent with this absolute magnitude, that originated in the Kuiper belt. This conclusion assumes that the rate of objects leaving the Kuiper belt has remained approximately constant over the history of the Solar System. We calculate the orbital distribution of this population and show that ˜90% are beyond the orbit of Neptune at any given time. In addition, we calculate the impact rates of these objects onto the planets. We find that a JFC impact onto Jupiter happens approximately once every 400 years and one on the Earth should occur once every 13 million years.},

	Abstract = {We study the evolution of long-period comets by numerical integration of their orbits, a more realistic dynamical approach than the Monte Carlo and analytic methods previously used to study this problem. We follow the comets from their origin in the Oort cloud until their final escape or destruction, in a model solar system consisting of the Sun, the four giant planets and the Galactic tide. We also examine the effects of nongravitational forces as well as the gravitational forces from a hypothetical solar companion or circumsolar disk. We confirm the conclusion of Oort and other investigators that the observed distribution of long-period comet orbits does not match the expected steady-state distribution unless there is fading or some similar physical process that depletes the population of older comets. We investigate several simple fading laws. We can match the observed orbit distribution if the fraction of comets remaining observable aftermapparitions is ∝m-0.6$\pm$0.1(close to the fading law originally proposed by Whipple 1962); or if approximately 95% of comets live for only a few (~6) returns and the remainder last indefinitely. Our results also yield statistics such as the expected perihelion distribution, distribution of aphelion directions, frequency of encounters with the giant planets and the rate of production of Halley-type comets.},

	Abstract = {We present numerical simulations to model the production of observable long-period comets (LPCs) from the Oort Cloud, a vast reservoir of icy bodies surrounding the Sun. We show that inner Oort Cloud objects can penetrate Jupiter's orbit via a largely unexplored dynamical pathway, and they are an important, if not the dominant, source of known LPCs. We use this LPC production to place observationally motivated constraints on the population and mass of the inner Oort Cloud, which are consistent with giant planet formation theory. These constraints indicate that only one comet shower producing late Eocene bombardment levels has likely occurred since the Cambrian Explosion, making these phenomena an improbable cause of additional extinction events.},

They assume that comets formed in the outer planetary region and that their orbits evolved to their current state through planetary perturbations, stellar encounters, and the galactic tide. The evolution is followed using a hybrid integration scheme which directly integrates the regularized equations of motion for cometary orbits with large semimajor axes, while solving an energy-diffusion equation for more tightly bound orbits. Stellar encounters are introduced via a Monte Carlo approach using the impulse approximation. The results of the simulations are discussed in detail.},

@inproceedings{Dones:2001aa,
	Abstract = {The standard model for the formation of the Oort cloud (OC) of comets assumes that the giant planets pump small bodies into orbits with large aphelion distances. Galactic tides and passing stars then raise the bodies' perihelia out of the planetary region. Dynamical simulations have shown that only ~ 2.5% of the planetesimals with initial semi-major axes, a, between 4 and 40 AU should reside in the outer Oort cloud (a > 15,000 AU) at present ([1]). Assuming an outer OC population of 1012 comets and an average cometary mass of 4 x 1016 g ([2]), the original mass in planetesimals between 4 and 40 AU was { ~}250M⊕ , some 4 times the mass in solids in a minimum-mass solar nebula. This amount of mass likely would have produced excessive migration of the giant planets ([3]). Furthermore, the predicted population of the inner OC is comparable to that of the outer OC ([1]), whereas the observed orbital distribution of Halley-type comets ([4]) appears to require a massive inner OC as a source region. Several groups have recently considered other physical effects that may help to resolve these discrepancies ([5]-[7]). We will review these effects, and will present new calculations which include (i) gas drag in the solar nebula, (ii) the growth of Jupiter and Saturn, and (iii) small body eccentricities excited prior to the formation of the OC. Finally, we will discuss whether these effects can resolve the discrepancies between the standard model and observations.

@inproceedings{Weissman:1996aa,
	Abstract = {Dynamical studies during the past two decades have greatly increased our understanding of the Oort cloud of comets which surrounds the solar system. Cometary orbits in the cloud evolve under the complex interaction of stellar, galactic, and giant molecular cloud perturbations, as well as planetary and nongravitational perturbations when the comets re-enter the planetary region. Evidence has continued to build for a dense, inner Oort cloud of comets which acts as a reservoir to replenish the outer cloud as comets there are stripped away. The total number of comets in the dynamically active outer Oort cloud is on the order of $1012$, and about five times that number in the unseen inner Oort cloud, with a total estimated mass of $\sim$38 Earth masses. Temporal variations in the flux of comets from the Oort cloud into the planetary region by a factor of four are possible due to the varying galactic tide, and by a factor of $\sim$300 due to perturbations by stars penetrating the Oort cloud or close GMC encounters. The most intense cometary ``showers'' may result in biological extinction events on the Earth. Comets in the Oort cloud are processed by galactic cosmic rays, heated by nearby supernovae, eroded by interstellar dust impacts, and disrupted by mutual collisions (in the inner cloud). A detailed estimate of the Oort cloud's dynamical history is not possible because of the inability to reconstruct the Sun's varying galactic motion over the history of the solar system, and because of uncertainty over where comets actually formed. However, it is likely that a substantial fraction of the original Oort cloud population has been lost to interstellar space. We are approaching the time when Oort clouds around other stars may be detectable, though searches to date have so far been negative.},

The goal of the paper was to check the conservation of various formulations of the Tisserand parameter and to investigate the relationships between theT-values and the dynamical behaviours at close encounters with Jupiter. A first draft of the paper was subsequently enlarged and revised in 1983, as new findings led us to the addition of another substantial section. Then, the paper has remained in a draft version up to now, being modified from time to time because of our committments with the computations of long-term evolutions of short-period comets. We want to honour the memory of Lubor letting this article finally come out. Andrea Carusi and Giovanni B. Valsecchi, Rome, 1994},

	Abstract = {The source HD 172555 is a young A7V star surrounded by a debris disk with a gaseous component. Here, we present the detection of variable absorption features detected simultaneously in the Ca II K and H doublet lines (at lambda3933 {\AA} and lambda3968 {\AA}). We identified the presence of these absorption signatures at four different epochs in the 129 HARPS high-resolution spectra gathered between 2004 and 2011. These transient absorption features are most likely due to falling evaporating bodies (FEBs, or exocomets) that produce absorbing gas observed transiting in front of the central star. We also detect a stable Ca II absorption component at the star's radial velocity. With no corresponding detection in the Na I line, the resulting very low upper limit for the Na I/Ca II ratio suggests that this absorption is due to circumstellar gas.},

	Abstract = {We present medium spectral resolution (R ~ 60,000) observations of the CaII K-line (3,933 {\AA}) absorption profiles observed toward 21 nearby A-type stars thought to possess circumstellar gas debris disks. The stars were repeatedly observed over two observing runs on the 2.1 m Otto Struve telescope at the McDonald Observatory, Texas in 2011 May and 2012 November. Nightly changes in the absorption strength of the CaII K-line near the stellar radial velocity were observed in four of the stars (HD 21620, HD 110411, HD 145964 and HD 183324). This type of absorption variability indicates the presence of a circumstellar gas disk around these stars. We also have detected weak absorption features that sporadically appear with velocities in the range $\pm$ 100 km s-1 of the main circumstellar K-line in the spectra of HD 21620, HD 42111, HD 110411 and HD 145964. Due to the known presence of both gas and dust disks surrounding these four stars, these transient absorption features are most probably associated with the presence of Falling Evaporated Bodies (FEBs, or exocomets) that are thought to liberate gas on their grazing trajectory toward and around the central star. This now brings the total number of A-type stars in which the evaporation of CaII gas from protoplanetary bodies (i.e., exocomets) has been observed to vary on a nightly basis to 10 systems. A statistical analysis of the 10 A-stars showing FEB-activity near the CaII K-line compared to 21 A-type stars that exhibit no measurable variability reveals that FEB-activity occurs in significantly younger stellar systems that also exhibit chemical peculiarities. The presence of FEB-activity does not appear to be associated with a strong mid-IR excess. This is probably linked to the disk inclination angle, since unless the viewing angle is favorable the detection of time-variable absorption may be unlikely. Additionally, if the systems are more evolved then the evaporation of gas due to FEB activity could have ceased, whereas the circumstellar dust disk may still remain.},

@article{Beust:1990aa,
	Abstract = {The temporal variations in some metallic absorption lines of Beta Pic's spectrum had been already interpreted as the result of the infall of small evaporating cometary-like bodies onto the star. To check this scenario, a model of such an evaporation has been developed, and subsequent numerical simulations have been carried out. This theoretical work has highlighted that the suggested scenario reproduces fairly well the observations, even the drastic difference between the behavior of Ca II lines on the one hand, and Al III and Mg II ones on the other hand, which is mainly due to radiation pressure acting differently on these ions. Assumptions on the evaporation's characteristics and, especially, on the orbits followed by the infalling bodies have been deduced from the simulation. These geometrical results suggest that the infalling objects may come into the star's vicinity from a precise direction. These rather frequent infalls could be then interpreted as the result of the perturbing action of an eventual planetary or protoplanetary body present in the disk on a large amount of small passing-by bodies.},

@inproceedings{Levison:1996aa,
	Abstract = {The current comet classification scheme is reevaluated in terms of the most recent models of the origin and dynamical evolution of comets and is found to be wanting. After a review of the current theories of the origin of comets and of the results of recent numerical simulations, a new taxonomy is developed. The main division between comets is defined by the Tisserand parameter, $T$, which is a measure of the influence of Jupiter on the dynamics of the comets. Comets with $T<2$ are called `nearly-isotropic' comets because they have a fairly uniform inclination distribution. Comets with $T>2$ are designated as `ecliptic' comets because of their very flat inclination distribution. Long-term dynamical integrations by Levison \& Duncan~(1994) have shown that over 90\% of comets with periods currently less than 200 years remain in one of these two classes throughout their dynamical lifetimes. These new classes are thus dynamically significant and probably reflect the origin of the comets they contain. These classes are further subdivided as described below. In addition, this new scheme is compared to an exciting new classification scheme based on the chemical abundances of comets.},

	Abstract = {The rate at which angular momentum and energy are transferred between a disk and a satellite which orbit a central mass is calculated. It is shown that the angular momentum and energy transfer at Lindblad resonances tends to increase the satellite's orbit to lowest order in eccentricity, whereas the transfer at corotation resonances tends to decrease it. The results are applied to the interaction between Jupiter and the protoplanetary disk. The angular momentum transfer is shown to be so rapid that substantial changes in both the structure of the disk and the orbit of Jupiter must have taken place on a time scale of a few thousand years.},

	Abstract = {THE recent discovery1 and confirmation2 of a possible planetary companion orbiting the solar-type star 51 Pegasi represent a breakthrough in the search for extrasolar planetary systems. Analysis of systematic variations in the velocity of the star indicate that the mass of the companion is approximately that of Jupiter, and that it is travelling in a nearly circular orbit at a distance from the star of 0.05 AU (about seven stellar radii). Here we show that, if the companion is indeed a gas-giant planet, it is extremely unlikely to have formed at its present location. We suggest instead that the planet probably formed by gradual accretion of solids and capture of gas at a much larger distance from the star (~5 AU), and that it subsequently migrated inwards through interactions with the remnants of the circumstellar disk. The planet's migration may have stopped in its present orbit as a result of tidal interactions with the star, or through truncation of the inner circumstellar disk by the stellar magnetosphere.},

	Abstract = {We present an ultra-deep survey for Neptune Trojans using the Subaru 8.2 m and Magellan 6.5 m telescopes. The survey reached a 50% detection efficiency in the R band at mR = 25.7 mag and covered 49 deg2 of sky. mR = 25.7 mag corresponds to Neptune Trojans that are about 16 km in radius (assuming an albedo of 0.05). A paucity of smaller Neptune Trojans (radii < 45 km) compared with larger ones was found. The brightest Neptune Trojans appear to follow a steep power-law slope (q = 5 $\pm$ 1) similar to the brightest objects in the other known stable reservoirs such as the Kuiper Belt, Jupiter Trojans, and main belt asteroids. We find a roll-over for the Neptune Trojans that occurs around a radius of r = 45 $\pm$ 10 km (mR = 23.5 $\pm$ 0.3), which is also very similar to the other stable reservoirs. All the observed stable regions in the solar system show evidence for Missing Intermediate-Sized Planetesimals (MISPs). This indicates a primordial and not collisional origin, which suggests that planetesimal formation proceeded directly from small to large objects. The scarcity of intermediate- and smaller-sized Neptune Trojans may limit them as being a strong source for the short period comets.},

	Abstract = {Several important consequences that would arise for the solar system's comet population if the Sun formed in an embedded star cluster are outlined. Owing to the higher stellar number density and larger tidal fields in this environment, formation of the comet cloud would proceed differently from that envisaged in a usually assumed isolated solar nebula scenario. In particular, early planetesimal scattering by the giant planets may lead to a substantial population of free-floating intracluster comets. Furthermore, the potentially important influence the primordial binaries may have had for cometary dynamics is emphasized. Long-period binaries are likely to accelerate planetesimal growth, and short-period binaries increase the capture cross-section of intracluster comets. Some of the intracluster comets might have been captured by the Sun and remained bound to it until after the cluster dispersed. If captured comets were in stable orbits over the remaining age of the solar system, it is expected they will constitute a second class of comets in addition to the comets scattered outwards by the planets.},

	Abstract = {A possible interaction between Oort's cloud and a star passing through it is discussed. It is shown that the product of stellar mass and stellar space density in the case of a specific encounter scenario is approximately equal to the distributed density of dense interstellar molecular clouds near the galactic plane and near 10 kpc distance from the galactic center. The statistical effects of such encounters on the size of Oort's cloud are examined, and the observed present extent of Oort's cloud is shown to be consistent with an estimated radius of approximately 0.25 pc. The possible present number density of interstellar cometesimals is considered. It is concluded that no observed comet is likely to have originated in interstellar space.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of 2012 VP113 initiated the debate on the origin of the Sedna family of planetesimals in orbit around the Sun. Sednitos roam the outer regions of the Solar system between the Egeworth-Kuiper belt and the Oort Cloud, in extraordinary wide (a > 150 au) orbits with a large perihelion distance of q > 30 au compared to the Earth's (a ≡ 1 au and eccentricity e ≡ (1 - q/a) ~= 0.0167 or q ~= 1 au). This population is composed of a dozen objects, which we consider a family because they have similar perihelion distance and inclination with respect to the ecliptic i = 10$\,^{\circ}$-30$\,^{\circ}$. They also have similar argument of perihelion omega = 340$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 55$\,^{\circ}$. There is no ready explanation for their origin. Here we show that these orbital parameters are typical for a captured population from the planetesimal disc of another star. Assuming that the orbital elements of Sednitos have not changed since they acquired their orbits, we reconstruct the encounter that led to their capture. We conclude that they might have been captured in a near miss with a 1.8 M&sun; star that impacted the Sun at ~= 340 au at an inclination with respect to the ecliptic of 17$\,^{\circ}$-34$\,^{\circ}$ with a relative velocity at infinity of ˜4.3 km s-1. We predict that the Sednitos region is populated by 930 planetesimals and the inner Oort Cloud acquired ˜440 planetesimals through the same encounter.},

	Abstract = {We present Monte Carlo simulations of the dynamical evolution of the Oort cloud over the age of the Solar System, using an initial sample of one million test comets without any cloning. Our model includes perturbations due to the Galactic tide (radial and vertical) and passing stars. We present the first detailed analysis of the injection mechanism into observable orbits by comparing the complete model with separate models for tidal and stellar perturbations alone. We find that a fundamental role for injecting comets from the region outside the loss cone (perihelion distance q > 15 AU) into observable orbits ( q < 5 AU) is played by stellar perturbations. These act in synergy with the tide such that the total injection rate is significantly larger than the sum of the two separate rates. This synergy is as important during comet showers as during quiescent periods and concerns comets with both small and large semi-major axes. We propose different dynamical mechanisms to explain the synergies in the inner and outer parts of the Oort Cloud. We find that the filling of the observable part of the loss cone under normal conditions in the present-day Solar System rises from <1% for a < 20 000 AU to about 100% for a ≳ 100 000 AU.},

Detailed models of this process fail to reproduce  all of the available observational constraints, however. In particular,  the Oort cloud appears to be substantially more populous than the models  predict. Here we present numerical simulations that show that the Sun  captured comets from other stars while it was in its birth cluster.

	Abstract = {During a previous study models of the inner Oort cloud were built which included the effect of an embedded star cluster on cometary orbits about the Sun. The main conclusions were: the formation efficiency is about 10\%; the median distance of the cloud to the Sun only depends on the mean density the Sun encountered. We report on simulations which followed the dynamical evolution of these clouds in the current Galactic environment once the Sun left the star cluster. The question is whether or not the dynamical influence of passing stars and the Galactic tidal field is sufficient to replenish the current outer cloud (semi-major axis a ≈ AU) with enough material from the inner cloud (a ≈ AU). Since visible new comets come directly from the outer cloud, a mass estimate only exists for the latter, with a lower limit of 1 Me. The expansion of the inner cloud can yield an estimate of the mass of said inner cloud. Results indicate typically 10% of the comets from the inner cloud land in the outer cloud and are bound after 4.5 Gyr. If one assumes in the extreme case the majority of material in the current outer cloud came from the inner cloud, then a typical value of the mass of the inner cloud is about 10 Me. Since 10% of comets from the Jupiter-Saturn region were implanted in the inner Oort cloud, this implies about 100 Me for the mass of solids in the primordial Jupiter-Saturn region. This extreme case might be remedied as follows: either the effect of GMCs on the inner Oort cloud is much more severe than originally thought, or a two-stage formation process for the Oort cloud, in which the outer cloud was largely populated by comets once the Sun had left its primordial birth cluster.},

	Abstract = {Observations suggest most stars originate in clusters embedded in giant molecular clouds [Lada, C.J., Lada, E.A., 2003. Annu. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. 41, 57-115]. Our Solar System likely spent 1-5 Myrs in such regions just after it formed. Thus the Oort Cloud (OC) possibly retains evidence of the Sun's early dynamical history and of the stellar and tidal influence of the cluster. Indeed, the newly found objects (90377) Sedna and 2000 CR 105 may have been put on their present orbits by such processes [Morbidelli, A., Levison, H.F., 2004. Astron. J. 128, 2564-2576]. Results are presented here of numerical simulations of the orbital evolution of comets subject to the influence of the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn (with their current masses on orbits appropriate to the period before the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) [Tsiganis, K., Gomes, R., Morbidelli, A., Levison, H.F., 2005. Nature 435, 459-461]), passing stars and tidal force associated with the gas and stars of an embedded star cluster. The cluster was taken to be a Plummer model with 200-400 stars, with a range of initial central densities. The Sun's orbit was integrated in the cluster potential together with Jupiter and Saturn and the test particles. Stellar encounters were incorporated by directly integrating the effects of stars passing within a sphere centred on the Sun of radius equal to the Plummer radius for low-density clusters and half a Plummer radius for high-density clusters. The gravitational influence of the gas was modeled using the tidal force of the cluster potential. For a given solar orbit, the mean density, <rho>, was computed by orbit-averaging the density of material encountered. This parameter proved to be a good measure for predicting the properties of the OC. On average 2-18% of our initial sample of comets end up in the OC after 1-3 Myr. A comet is defined to be part of the OC if it is bound and has q>35 AU. Our models show that the median distance of an object in the OC scales approximately as < when <rho>≳10 Mpc. Our models easily produce objects on orbits like that of (90377) Sedna [Brown, M.E., Trujillo, C., Rabinowitz, D., 2004. Astrophys. J. 617, 645-649] within ˜1 Myr in cases where the mean density is 10 Mpc or higher; one needs mean densities of order 10 Mpc to create objects like 2000 CR 105 by this mechanism, which are reasonable (see, e.g., Guthermuth, R.A., Megeath, S.T., Pipher, J.L., Williams, J.P., Allen, L.E., Myers, P.C., Raines, S.N., 2005. Astrophys. J. 632, 397-420). Thus the latter object may also be part of the OC. Close stellar passages can stir the primordial Kuiper Belt to sufficiently high eccentricities ( e≳0.05; Kenyon, S.J., Bromley, B.C., 2002. Astron. J. 123, 1757-1775) that collisions become destructive. From the simulations performed it is determined that there is a 50% or better chance to stir the primordial Kuiper Belt to eccentricities e=>0.05 at 50 AU when <rho>≳10 Mpc. The orbit of the new object 2003 UB 313 [Brown, M.E., Trujillo, C.A., Rabinowitz, D.L., 2005. Astrophys. J. 635, L97-L100] is only reproduced for mean cluster densities of the order of 10 Mpc, but in the simulations it could not come to be on its current orbit by this mechanism without disrupting the formation of bodies in the primordial Kuiper Belt down to 20 AU. It is therefore improbable that the latter object is created by this mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M&sun;. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

	Abstract = {Jupiter's core is generally assumed to have formed beyond the snow line. Here we consider an alternative scenario that Jupiter's core may have accumulated in the innermost part of the protoplanetary disc. A growing body of research suggests that small particles (`pebbles') continually drift inward through the disc. If a fraction of drifting pebbles is trapped at the inner edge of the disc, several Earth-mass cores can quickly grow. Subsequently, the core may migrate outward beyond the snow line via planet-disc interactions. Of course, to reach the outer Solar system Jupiter's core must traverse the terrestrial planet-forming region. We use N-body simulations including synthetic forces from an underlying gaseous disc to study how the outward migration of Jupiter's core sculpts the terrestrial zone. If the outward migration is fast (taumig ˜ 104 yr), the core simply migrates past resident planetesimals and planetary embryos. However, if its migration is slower (taumig ˜ 105 yr) the core clears out solids in the inner disc by shepherding objects in mean motion resonances. In many cases, the disc interior to 0.5-1 AU is cleared of embryos and most planetesimals. By generating a mass deficit close to the Sun, the outward migration of Jupiter's core may thus explain the absence of terrestrial planets closer than Mercury. Jupiter's migrating core often stimulates the growth of another large (˜Earth-mass) core - that may provide a seed for Saturn's core - trapped in an exterior resonance. The migrating core also may transport a fraction of terrestrial planetesimals, such as the putative parent bodies of iron meteorites, to the asteroid belt.},

@article{Nimura:2016aa,
	Abstract = {We have identified iridium in an ~5 m-thick section of pelagic sediment cored in the deep sea floor at Site 886C, in addition to a distinct spike in iridium at the K-Pg boundary related to the Chicxulub asteroid impact. We distinguish the contribution of the extraterrestrial matter in the sediments from those of the terrestrial matter through a Co-Ir diagram, calling it the "extraterrestrial index" fEX. This new index reveals a broad iridium anomaly around the Chicxulub spike. Any mixtures of materials on the surface of the Earth cannot explain the broad iridium component. On the other hand, we find that an encounter of the solar system with a giant molecular cloud can aptly explain the component, especially if the molecular cloud has a size of ~100 pc and the central density of over 2000 protons/cm^3. Kataoka et al. (2013, 2014) pointed that an encounter with a dark cloud would drive an environmental catastrophe leading to mass extinction. Solid particles from the hypothesized dark cloud would combine with the global environment of Earth, remaining in the stratosphere for at least several months or years. With a sunshield effect estimated to be as large as -9.3 W m^-2, the dark cloud would have caused global climate cooling in the last 8 Myr of the Cretaceous period, consistent with the variations of stable isotope ratios in oxygen (Barrera and Huber, 1990; Li and Keller, 1998; Barrera and Savin, 1999; Li and Keller, 1999) and strontium (Barrera and Huber, 1990; Ingram, 1995; Sugarman et al., 1995). The resulting growth of the continental ice sheet also resulted in a regression of the sea level. The global cooling, which appears to be associated with a decrease in the diversity of fossils, eventually led to the mass extinction at the K-Pg boundary.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a precise near-infrared (NIR) radial velocity (RV) survey of 32 low-mass stars with spectral types K2-M4 using CSHELL at the NASA IRTF in the $K$-band with an isotopologue methane gas cell to achieve wavelength calibration and a novel iterative RV extraction method. We surveyed 14 members of young ($\approx$ 25-150 Myr) moving groups, the young field star $\varepsilon$ Eridani as well as 18 nearby ($<$ 25 pc) low-mass stars and achieved typical single-measurement precisions of 8-15 m s$^{-1}$ with a long-term stability of 15-50 m s$^{-1}$. We obtain the best NIR RV constraints to date on 27 targets in our sample, 19 of which were never followed by high-precision RV surveys. Our results indicate that very active stars can display long-term RV variations as low as $\sim$ 25-50 m s$^{-1}$ at $\approx$ 2.3125 $\mu$m, thus constraining the effect of jitter at these wavelengths. We provide the first multi-wavelength confirmation of GJ 876 bc and independently retrieve orbital parameters consistent with previous studies. We recovered RV variability for HD 160934 AB and GJ 725 AB that are consistent with their known binary orbits, and nine other targets are candidate RV variables with a statistical significance of 3-5$\sigma$. Our method combined with the new iSHELL spectrograph will yield long-term RV precisions of $\lesssim$ 5 m s$^{-1}$ in the NIR, which will allow the detection of Super-Earths near the habitable zone of mid-M dwarfs.},

@article{Gould:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Microlensing is generally thought to probe planetary systems only out to a few Einstein radii. Microlensing events generated by bound planets beyond about 10 Einstein radii generally do not yield any trace of their hosts, and so would be classified as free floating planets (FFPs). I show that it is already possible, using adaptive optics (AO), to constrain the presence of potential hosts to FFP candidates at separations comparable to the Oort Cloud. With next-generation telescopes, planets at Kuiper-Belt separations can be probed. Next generation telescopes will also permit routine vetting for all FFP candidates, simply by obtaining second epochs 4-8 years after the event. At present, the search for such hosts is restricted to within the "confusion limit" of theta_confus ~ 250 mas, but future WFIRST observations will allow one to probe beyond this confusion limit as well.},

@article{Rein:2016aa,
	Abstract = {First-order variational equations are widely used in N-body simulations to study how nearby trajectories diverge from one another. These allow for efficient and reliable determinations of chaos indicators such as the Maximal Lyapunov characteristic Exponent (MLE) and the Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO). In this paper we lay out the theoretical framework to extend the idea of variational equations to higher order. We explicitly derive the differential equations that govern the evolution of second-order variations in the N-body problem. Going to second order opens the door to new applications, including optimization algorithms that require the first and second derivatives of the solution, like the classical Newton's method. Typically, these methods have faster convergence rates than derivative-free methods. Derivatives are also required for Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods which provide significantly shorter correlation times than standard methods. Such improved optimization methods can be applied to anything from radial-velocity/transit-timing-variation fitting to spacecraft trajectory optimization to asteroid deflection. We provide an implementation of first and second-order variational equations for the publicly available REBOUND integrator package. Our implementation allows the simultaneous integration of any number of first and second-order variational equations with the high-accuracy IAS15 integrator. We also provide routines to generate consistent and accurate initial conditions without the need for finite differencing.},

	Abstract = {The dominant paradigm in assigning "habitability"' to terrestrial planets is to define a circumstellar habitable zone: the locus of orbital radii in which the planet is neither too hot nor too cold for life as we know it. One dimensional climate models have identified theoretically impressive boundaries for this zone: a runaway greenhouse or water loss at the inner edge (Venus), and low-latitude glaciation followed by formation of CO2 clouds at the outer edge. A cottage industry now exists to "refine" the definition of these boundaries each year to the third decimal place of an AU. Using the same class of climate model, I show that the different climate states can overlap very substantially and that "snowball Earth", moist temperate climate, hot moist climate and a post-runaway dry climate can all be stable under the same solar flux. The radial extent of the temperate climate band is very narrow for pure water atmospheres, but can be widened with di-nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The width of the habitable zone is thus determined by the atmospheric inventories of these gases. Yet Earth teaches us that these abundances are very heavily influenced (perhaps even controlled) by biology. This is paradoxical: the habitable zone seeks to define the region a planet should be capable of harbouring life; yet whether the planet is inhabited will determine whether the climate may be habitable at any given distance from the star. This matters, because future life detection missions may use habitable zone boundaries in mission design.},

	Abstract = {Accurate direct N-body simulations help to obtain detailed information about the dynamical evolution of star clusters. They also enable comparisons with analytical models and Fokker-Planck or Monte Carlo methods. NBODY6 is a well-known direct N-body code for star clusters, and NBODY6++ is the extended version designed for large particle number simulations by supercomputers. We present NBODY6++GPU, an optimized version of NBODY6++ with hybrid parallelization methods (MPI, GPU, OpenMP, and AVX/SSE) to accelerate large direct N-body simulations, and in particular to solve the million-body problem. We discuss the new features of the NBODY6++GPU code, benchmarks, as well as the first results from a simulation of a realistic globular cluster initially containing a million particles. For million-body simulations, NBODY6++GPU is 400-2000 times faster than NBODY6 with 320 CPU cores and 32 NVIDIA K20X GPUs. With this computing cluster specification, the simulations of million-body globular clusters including 5 per cent primordial binaries require about an hour per half-mass crossing time.},

	Abstract = {Recent numerical simulations have demonstrated that the Sun's dynamical history within the Milky Way may be much more complex than that suggested by its current low peculiar velocity (Sellwood, J.A., Binney, J.J. [2002]. Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 336, 785-796; Ro\vskar, R., Debattista, V.P., Quinn, T.R., Stinson, G.S., Wadsley, J. [2008]. Astrophys. J. 684, L79-L82). In particular, the Sun may have radially migrated through the galactic disk by up to 5-6 kpc (Ro\vskar, R., Debattista, V.P., Quinn, T.R., Stinson, G.S., Wadsley, J. [2008]. Astrophys. J. 684, L79-L82). This has important ramifications for the structure of the Oort Cloud, as it means that the Solar System may have experienced tidal and stellar perturbations that were significantly different from its current local galactic environment. To characterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct numerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that end up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like disk formation. Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may belong to the classical Oort Cloud. Contrary to previous understanding, we show that field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the Oort Cloud's extreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edge sometimes extends to Sedna's orbit. The Sun's galactic migration heightens the chance of powerful stellar passages, and Sedna production occurs around ˜20-30% of the solar-like stars we study. Considering the entire Oort Cloud, we find its median distance depends on the minimum galactocentric distance attained during the Sun's orbital history. The inner edge also shows a similar dependence but with increased scatter due to the effects of powerful stellar encounters. Both of these Oort Cloud parameters can vary by an order of magnitude and are usually overestimated by an Oort Cloud formation model that assumes a fixed galactic environment. In addition, the amount of material trapped in outer Oort Cloud orbits ( a > 20,000 AU) can be extremely low and may present difficulties for traditional models of Oort Cloud formation and long-period comet production.},

@article{Pauco:2016aa,
	Abstract = {We reconsider the hypothesis of a vast cometary reservoir surrounding the Solar System- the Oort cloud of comets - within the framework of Milgromian Dynamics (MD or MOND). For this purpose we built a numerical model of the cloud, assuming the theory of modified gravity, QUMOND. In modified gravity versions of MD, the internal dynamics of a system is influenced by the external gravitational field in which the system is embedded, even when this external field is constant and uniform, a phenomenon dubbed the external field effect (EFE). Adopting the popular pair $\nu(x)=[1-\exp(-x^{1/2})]^{-1}$ for the MD interpolating function and $a_{0}=1.2\times10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ for the MD acceleration scale, we found that the observationally inferred Milgromian cloud of comets is much more radially compact than its Newtonian counterpart. The comets of the Milgromian cloud stay away from the zone where the Galactic tide can torque their orbits significantly. However, this does not need to be an obstacle for the injection of the comets into the inner solar system as the EFE can induce significant change in perihelion distance during one revolution of a comet around the Sun. Adopting constraints on different interpolating function families and a revised value of $a_{0}$ (provided recently by the Cassini spacecraft), the aforementioned qualitative results no longer hold, and, in conclusion, the Milgromian cloud is very similar to the Newtonian in its overall size, binding energies of comets and hence the operation of the Jupiter-Saturn barrier. However, EFE torquing of perihelia still play a significant role in the inner parts of the cloud. Consequently Sedna-like orbits and orbits of large semi-major axis Centaurs are easily comprehensible in MD. In MD, they both belong to the same population, just in different modes of their evolution.},

@article{Mazeh:2016aa,
	Abstract = {A few studies have noticed a significant dearth of Neptune-mass/radius exoplanets with orbital periods below $2$--$4$ d. This cannot be explained by observational biases, as many Neptunian planets with longer orbital periods have been detected. The existence of this "desert" is similar to the appearance of the "brown-dwarf desert", which suggests different formation mechanisms of planets and stellar companions with short orbital periods. Similarly, the Neptunian desert could indicate different mechanisms of formation and evolution for hot Jupiters and short-period super-Earths. As done by Szab\'o & Kiss (2011), we study here the location and shape of the desert in both the period-mass and the period-radius planes, using the presently available large samples of planets. The desert in the period-mass plane has a relatively sharp upper edge, with planetary mass that is inversely proportional to the planetary orbital period, while the lower, somewhat blurred, boundary, is along mass that is apparently linearly proportional to the period. The desert in the period-radius plane of the transiting planets is less clear. It seems as if along the upper boundary the radius is inversely proportional to the period to the power of one third, while the lower boundary shows a radius that is proportional to the period to the power of two thirds. The combination of the two upper bounds of the desert, in the period-mass and period-radius planes, yields a planetary mass-radius relation of $R_{\rm p}/R_{\rm Jup}\simeq (1.2\pm0.3)(M_{\rm p}/M_{\rm Jup})^{0.27\pm0.11} \,$ for $ 0.1\lesssim M_{\rm p}/M_{\rm Jup}\lesssim 1$. The derived shape of the desert, which might extend up to periods of $5$--$10$ d, could shed some light on the formation and evolution of close-in planets.},

	Abstract = {The theoretically-determined location of the boundary between semimajor axes of those comets entering the planetary system only in bursts or showers, and those which arrive in a steady stream, is abrupt and falls at the observed inner edge of the Oort cloud. It is proposed that the comets were formed in the outer parts of the collapsing protosun, which had a radius of less than 5000 AU. If so, then: (1) a first-generation comet cloud may have been produced, with a radius of more than 1000 AU, and the coupled dynamical perturbations of passing stars and Jupiter would lead to the formation of a comet cloud similar to the Oort; while (2) if the Oort cloud comets originated in this inner cloud, and were later ejected into their present orbits by the perturbations of passing stars and Jupiter, the total inner cloud mass is two orders of magnitude greater than that of the Oort cloud.},

It also integrates the motion of 300 perturbing main belt asteroids, the rotation of the Earth and the Moon libration. We used more than 55000 observations including the last tracking data of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and Mars Odyssey (Odyssey) missions. The accuracy obtained with INPOP06 is comparable to the accuracy of last versions of the JPL DE ephemerides (DE414, Standish 2003, JPL IOM, 312N, 03; Konopliv et al. 2006, Icarus, 182, 23) and of the EPM ephemerides (EPM2004, Pitjeva 2005, Sol. Syst. Res., 39, 176). The reader should refer to the full paper (Fienga et al., 2008) for a detailed description of this new planetary ephemeris. The account of the ongoing effort on the fit of the INPOP ephemeris to lunar laser ranging data is provided in the companion paper (Manche et al., 2008) of the present volume.},

@article{Nesvorny:2016aa,
	Abstract = {The Kuiper belt is a population of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. The complex orbital structure of the Kuiper belt, including several categories of objects inside and outside of resonances with Neptune, emerged as a result of Neptune's migration into an outer planetesimal disk. An outstanding problem with the existing migration models is that they invariably predict excessively large resonant populations, while observations show that the non-resonant orbits are in fact common (e.g., the main belt population is 2-4 times larger than Plutinos in the 3:2 resonance). Here we show that this problem can resolved if it is assumed that Neptune's migration was grainy, as expected from scattering encounters of Neptune with massive planetesimals. The grainy migration acts to destabilize resonant bodies with large libration amplitudes, a fraction of which ends up on stable non-resonant orbits. Thus, the non-resonant--to--resonant ratio obtained with the grainy migration is higher, up to ~10 times higher for the range of parameters investigated here, than in a model with smooth migration. The grainy migration leads to a narrower distribution of the libration amplitudes in the 3:2 resonance. The best fit to observations is obtained when it is assumed that the outer planetesimal disk below 30 AU contained 1000-4000 Plutos, or ~1000 bodies twice as massive as Pluto. We find that the probability for an outer disk object to end up on a stable orbit in the Kuiper belt is ~10^{-3}. Together, these results are consistent with having only two (known) Pluto-mass bodies in the Kuiper belt today (Pluto and Eris). The combined mass of Pluto-class objects in the original disk was ~2-8 Earth masses (M_Earth), which represents 10-40% of the estimated disk mass (M_disk ~ 20 M_Earth).},

	Abstract = {Cosmology experiments at mm-wavelengths may be able to detect Planet Nine if it is the size of Neptune, has an effective temperature of 40 K, and is 700 AU from the Sun. It would appear as a ~30 mJy source at 1 mm (or ~8 mJy at 150 GHz) with a parallax of ~5 arcmin. The challenge will be to distinguish it from the ~4000 foreground asteroids brighter than 30 mJy. Fortunately, asteroids can by identified by looking for sources that move across a resolution element in a matter of hours, orders of magnitude faster than Planet Nine. If Planet Nine is smaller, colder, and/or more distant than expected, then it could be as faint as 1 mJy at 1 mm. There are approximately 1E6 asteroids this bright, making many cosmology experiments confusion limited for moving sources. Nonetheless, it may still be possible to find the proverbial needle in the haystack using a matched filter. This would require mm telescopes with high angular resolution and high sensitivity in order to alleviate confusion and to enable the identification of moving sources with relatively short time baselines. Regardless of its mm flux density, searching for Planet Nine would entail obtaining frequent radio measurements for large swaths of the sky, including the ecliptic and Galactic plane. Even if Planet Nine had already been detected by other means, measuring its mm-flux would constrain its internal energy budget, and therefore help resolve the mystery of Uranus and Neptune, which have vastly different internal heat.},

	Abstract = {To explain the unusual distribution of Kuiper Belt objects, several authors have advocated the existence of a super-Earth planet in the outer solar system. It has recently been proposed that a 10 M$_{\oplus}$ object with an orbit of 700 AU semi major axis and 0.6 eccentricity can explain the observed distribution of Kuiper Belt objects around Sedna. Here we use the INPOP planetary ephemerides model as a sensor for testing for an additional body in the solar system. We test the possibility of adding the proposed planet without increasing the residuals of the planetary ephemerides, fitted over the whole INPOP planetary data sample. We demonstrate that the presence of such an object is not compatible with the most sensitive data set, the Cassini radio ranging data, if its true anomaly is in the intervals $[-130^\circ:-100^\circ]$ or $[-65^\circ : 85^\circ]$. Moreover, we find that the addition of this object can reduce the Cassini residuals, with a most probable position given by a true anomaly $v = {117.8^\circ}^{ + 11^\circ}_{ - 10^\circ} $.},

	Abstract = {Motivated by the dynamics of resonance capture, we study numerically the coorbital resonance for inclination180 >=I>=0 in the circular restricted three-body problem. We examine the similarities and differences between planar and three dimensional coorbital resonance capture and seek their origin in the stability of coorbital motion at arbitrary inclination. After we present stability maps of the planar prograde and retrograde coorbital resonances, we characterize the new coorbital modes in three dimensions. We see that retrograde mode I (R1) and mode II (R2) persist as we change the relative inclination, while retrograde mode III (R3) seems to exist only in the planar problem. A new coorbital mode (R4) appears in 3D which is a retrograde analogue to an horseshoe-orbit. The Kozai-Lidov resonance is active for retrograde orbits as well as prograde orbits and plays a key role in coorbital resonance capture. Stable coorbital modes exist at all inclinations, including retrograde and polar obits. This result confirms the robustness the coorbital resonance at large inclination and encourages the search for retrograde coorbital companions of the solar system's planets.},

	Abstract = {Planets around binary stars and those in multiplanet systems may experience resonant eccentricity excitation and disruption due to perturbations from a distant stellar companion. This "evection resonance" occurs when the apsidal precession frequency of the planet, driven by the quadrupole associated with the inner binary or the other planets, matches the orbital frequency of the external companion. We develop an analytic theory to study the effects of evection resonance on circumbinary planets and multiplanet systems. We derive the general conditions for effective eccentricity excitation or resonance capture of the planet as the system undergoes long-term evolution. Applying to circumbinary planets, we show that inward planet migration may lead to eccentricity growth due to evection resonance with an external perturber, and planets around shrinking binaries may not survive the resonant eccentricity growth. On the other hand, significant eccentricity excitation in multiplanet systems occurs in limited parameter space of planet and binary semimajor axes, and requires the planetary migration to be sufficiently slow.},

	Abstract = {We present the seventh Kepler planet candidate catalog, which is the first to be based on the entire, uniformly processed, 48 month Kepler dataset. This is the first fully automated catalog, employing robotic vetting procedures to uniformly evaluate every periodic signal detected by the Q1-Q17 Data Release 24 (DR24) Kepler pipeline. While we prioritize uniform vetting over the absolute correctness of individual objects, we find that our robotic vetting is overall comparable to, and in most cases is superior to, the human vetting procedures employed by past catalogs. This catalog is the first to utilize artificial transit injection to evaluate the performance of our vetting procedures and quantify potential biases, which are essential for accurate computation of planetary occurrence rates. With respect to the cumulative Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) catalog, we designate 1,478 new KOIs, of which 402 are dispositioned as planet candidates (PCs). Also, 237 KOIs dispositioned as false positives (FPs) in previous Kepler catalogs have their disposition changed to PC and 118 PCs have their disposition changed to FP. This brings the total number of known KOIs to 8,826 and planet candidates to 4,696. We compare the Q1-Q17 DR24 KOI catalog to previous KOI catalogs, as well as ancillary Kepler catalogs, finding good agreement between them. We highlight new PCs that are both potentially rocky and potentially in the habitable zone of their host stars, many of which orbit solar-type stars. This work represents significant progress in accurately determining the fraction of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. The full catalog is publicly available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.},

@article{Batygin:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Recent analyses have shown that distant orbits within the scattered disk population of the Kuiper Belt exhibit an unexpected clustering in their respective arguments of perihelion. While several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this alignment, to date, a theoretical model that can successfully account for the observations remains elusive. In this work we show that the orbits of distant Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) cluster not only in argument of perihelion, but also in physical space. We demonstrate that the perihelion positions and orbital planes of the objects are tightly confined and that such a clustering has only a probability of 0.007% to be due to chance, thus requiring a dynamical origin. We find that the observed orbital alignment can be maintained by a distant eccentric planet with mass ≳10 m⊕ whose orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those of the distant KBOs, but whose perihelion is 180$\,^{\circ}$ away from the perihelia of the minor bodies. In addition to accounting for the observed orbital alignment, the existence of such a planet naturally explains the presence of high-perihelion Sedna-like objects, as well as the known collection of high semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60$\,^{\circ}$ and 150$\,^{\circ}$ whose origin was previously unclear. Continued analysis of both distant and highly inclined outer solar system objects provides the opportunity for testing our hypothesis as well as further constraining the orbital elements and mass of the distant planet.},

@article{Dones:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Comets have three known reservoirs: the roughly spherical Oort Cloud (for long-period comets), the flattened Kuiper Belt (for ecliptic comets), and, surprisingly, the asteroid belt (for main-belt comets). Comets in the Oort Cloud were thought to have formed in the region of the giant planets and then placed in quasi-stable orbits at distances of thousands or tens of thousands of AU through the gravitational effects of the planets and the Galaxy. The planets were long assumed to have formed in place. However, the giant planets may have undergone two episodes of migration. The first would have taken place in the first few million years of the Solar System, during or shortly after the formation of the giant planets, when gas was still present in the protoplanetary disk around the Sun. The Grand Tack (Walsh et al. in Nature 475:206-209, 2011) models how this stage of migration could explain the low mass of Mars and deplete, then repopulate the asteroid belt, with outer-belt asteroids originating between, and outside of, the orbits of the giant planets. The second stage of migration would have occurred later (possibly hundreds of millions of years later) due to interactions with a remnant disk of planetesimals, i.e., a massive ancestor of the Kuiper Belt. Safronov (Evolution of the Protoplanetary Cloud and Formation of the Earth and the Planets, 1969) and Fern{\'a}ndez and Ip (Icarus 58:109-120, 1984) proposed that the giant planets would have migrated as they interacted with leftover planetesimals; Jupiter would have moved slightly inward, while Saturn and (especially) Uranus and Neptune would have moved outward from the Sun. Malhotra (Nature 365:819-821, 1993) showed that Pluto's orbit in the 3:2 resonance with Neptune was a natural outcome if Neptune captured Pluto into resonance while it migrated outward. Building on this work, Tsiganis et al. (Nature 435:459-461, 2005) proposed the Nice model, in which the giant planets formed closer together than they are now, and underwent a dynamical instability that led to a flood of comets and asteroids throughout the Solar System (Gomes et al. in Nature 435:466-469, 2005b). In this scenario, it is somewhat a matter of luck whether an icy planetesimal ends up in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud (Brasser and Morbidelli in Icarus 225:40-49, 2013), as a Trojan asteroid (Morbidelli et al. in Nature 435:462-465, 2005; Nesvorn{\'y} and Vokrouhlick{\'y} in Astron. J. 137:5003-5011, 2009; Nesvorn{\'y} et al. in Astrophys. J. 768:45, 2013), or as a distant "irregular" satellite of a giant planet (Nesvorn{\'y} et al. in Astron. J. 133:1962-1976, 2007). Comets could even have been captured into the asteroid belt (Levison et al. in Nature 460:364-366, 2009). The remarkable finding of two "inner Oort Cloud" bodies, Sedna and 2012 VP_{113}, with perihelion distances of 76 and 81 AU, respectively (Brown et al. in Astrophys. J. 617:645-649, 2004; Trujillo and Sheppard in Nature 507:471-474, 2014), along with the discovery of other likely inner Oort Cloud bodies (Chen et al. in Astrophys. J. Lett. 775:8, 2013; Brasser and Schwamb in Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 446:3788-3796, 2015), suggests that the Sun formed in a denser environment, i.e., in a star cluster (Brasser et al. in Icarus 184:59-82, 2006, 191:413-433, 2007, 217:1-19, 2012b; Kaib and Quinn in Icarus 197:221-238, 2008). The Sun may have orbited closer or further from the center of the Galaxy than it does now, with implications for the structure of the Oort Cloud (Kaib et al. in Icarus 215:491-507, 2011).},

	Abstract = {It has been established that, owing to the proximity of a resonance with Jupiter, Mercury's eccentricity can be pumped to values large enough to allow collision with Venus within 5Gyr (refs 1-3). This conclusion, however, was established either with averaged equations that are not appropriate near the collisions or with non-relativistic models in which the resonance effect is greatly enhanced by a decrease of the perihelion velocity of Mercury. In these previous studies, the Earth's orbit was essentially unaffected. Here we report numerical simulations of the evolution of the Solar System over 5Gyr, including contributions from the Moon and general relativity. In a set of 2,501 orbits with initial conditions that are in agreement with our present knowledge of the parameters of the Solar System, we found, as in previous studies, that one per cent of the solutions lead to a large increase in Mercury's eccentricity-an increase large enough to allow collisions with Venus or the Sun. More surprisingly, in one of these high-eccentricity solutions, a subsequent decrease in Mercury's eccentricity induces a transfer of angular momentum from the giant planets that destabilizes all the terrestrial planets ~3.34Gyr from now, with possible collisions of Mercury, Mars or Venus with the Earth.},

	Abstract = {The prime Kepler mission revealed that small planets (<4 R_earth) are common, especially around low-mass M dwarfs. K2, the re-purposed Kepler mission, continues this exploration of small planets around small stars. Here we combine K2 photometry with spectroscopy, adaptive optics imaging, and archival survey images to analyze two small planets orbiting the nearby, field age, M dwarfs K2-26 (EPIC 202083828) and K2-9. K2-26 is an M1.0 +/- 0.5 dwarf at 93 +/- 7 pc from K2 Campaign 0. We validate its 14.5665 d period planet and estimate a radius of 2.67^+0.46_-0.42 R_earth. K2-9 is an M2.5 +/- 0.5 dwarf at 110 +/- 12 pc from K2 Campaign 1. K2-9b was first identified by Montet et al. 2015; here we present spectra and adaptive optics imaging of the host star and independently validate and characterize the planet. Our analyses indicate K2-9b is a 2.25^+0.53_-0.96 R_earth planet with a 18.4498 d period. K2-26b exhibits a transit duration that is too long to be consistent with a circular orbit given the measured stellar radius. Thus, the long transits are likely due to the photoeccentric effect and our transit fits hint at an eccentric orbit. Both planets receive low incident flux from their host stars and have estimated equilibrium temperatures <500 K. K2-9b may receive approximately Earth-like insolation. However, its host star exhibits strong GALEX UV emission which could affect any atmosphere it harbors. K2-26b and K2-9b are representatives of a poorly studied class of small planets with cool temperatures that have radii intermediate to Earth and Neptune. Future study of these systems can provide key insight into trends in bulk composition and atmospheric properties at the transition from silicate dominated to volatile rich bodies.},

	Abstract = {The provenance of water and organic compounds on Earth and other terrestrial planets has been discussed for a long time without reaching a consensus. One of the best means to distinguish between different scenarios is by determining the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratios in the reservoirs for comets and Earth's oceans. Here, we report the direct in situ measurement of the D/H ratio in the Jupiter family comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the ROSINA mass spectrometer aboard the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft, which is found to be (5.3 $\pm$ 0.7) × 10-4---that is, approximately three times the terrestrial value. Previous cometary measurements and our new finding suggest a wide range of D/H ratios in the water within Jupiter family objects and preclude the idea that this reservoir is solely composed of Earth ocean-like water.},

@article{Bitsch:2015aa,
	Abstract = {The formation of planets with gaseous envelopes takes place in protoplanetary accretion discs on time scales of several million years. Small dust particles stick to each other to form pebbles, pebbles concentrate in the turbulent flow to form planetesimals and planetary embryos and grow to planets, which undergo substantial radial migration. All these processes are influenced by the underlying structure of the protoplanetary disc, specifically the profiles of temperature, gas scale height, and density. The commonly used disc structure of the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN) is a simple power law in all these quantities. However, protoplanetary disc models with both viscous and stellar heating show several bumps and dips in temperature, scale height, and density caused by transitions in opacity, which are missing in the MMSN model. These play an important role in the formation of planets, since they can act as sweet spots for forming planetesimals via the streaming instability and affect the direction and magnitude of type-I migration. We present 2D simulations of accretion discs that feature radiative cooling and viscous and stellar heating, and they are linked to the observed evolutionary stages of protoplanetary discs and their host stars. These models allow us to identify preferred planetesimal and planet formation regions in the protoplanetary disc as a function of the disc's metallicity, accretion rate, and lifetime. We derive simple fitting formulae that feature all structural characteristics of protoplanetary discs during the evolution of several Myr. These fits are straightforward for applying to modelling any growth stage of planets where detailed knowledge of the underlying disc structure is required.

@article{Sato:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Standard accretion disk models suggest that the snow line in the solar nebula migrated interior to the Earth's orbit in a late stage of nebula evolution. In this late stage, a significant amount of ice could have been delivered to 1 AU from outer regions in the form of mm to dm-sized "pebbles." This raises the question why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass being as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy pebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line assuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use a simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and radial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble accretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions presented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of terrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the strength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1 AU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while turbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos reside. We find that the final water content of the embryos falls below 0.023 wt% only if the disk is compact (< 100 AU), turbulence is strong at 1 AU, and the snow line arrives at 1 AU later than 2-4 Myr after disk formation. If the solar nebula extended to 300 AU, initially rocky embryos would have evolved into icy planets of 1-10 Earth masses unless the snow-line migration was slow. If the proto-Earth contained water of ~ 1 wt% as might be suggested by the density deficit of the Earth's outer core, the formation of the proto-Earth was possible with weaker turbulence and with earlier (> 0.5-2 Myr) snow-line migration.},

Using the mineral physics toolkit BurnMan to self-consistently calculate mass-radius models, we find that core radius, presence of light elements in the core and an upper-mantle consisting of low-pressure silicates have the largest effect on the final calculated mass at a given radius, none of which are included in current mass-radius models. We expand these results provide a self-consistent grid of compositionally as well as structurally constrained terrestrial mass-radius models for quantifying the likelihood of exoplanets being "Earth-like." We further apply this grid to Kepler-36b, finding that it is only ~20% likely to be structurally similar to the Earth with Si/Fe = 0.9 compared to Earth's Si/Fe = 1 and Sun's Si/Fe = 1.19.},

	Abstract = {The Minimum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN) is a protoplanetary disk that contains the minimum amount of solids necessary to build the planets of the solar system. Assuming that the giant planets formed in the compact configuration they have at the beginning of the "Nice model," Desch built a new MMSN. He finds a decretion disk, about 10 times denser than the well known Hayashi MMSN. The disk profile is almost stationary for about 10 million years. However, a planet in a protoplanetary disk migrates. In a massive, long-lived disk, this issue has to be addressed. With numerical simulations, we show that the four giant planets of the solar system could not survive in this disk. In particular, Jupiter enters the type III, runaway regime, and falls into the Sun like a stone. Known planet-planet interaction mechanisms to prevent migration fail in this nebula, in contrast to the Hayashi MMSN. Planetary migration constrains the construction of an MMSN. We show how this should be done self-consistently.},

	Abstract = {Context. Despite the thorough work of van Leeuwen (2007), the parallax of alpha Centauri is still far from being carved in stone. Any derivation of the individual masses is therefore uncertain, if not questionable. And yet, that does not prevent this system from being used for calibration purpose in several studies. Aims. Obtaining more accurate model-free parallax and individual masses of this system. Methods. With HARPS, the radial velocities are not only precise but also accurate. Ten years of HARPS data are enough to derive the complement of the visual orbit for a full 3D orbit of alpha Cen. Results. We locate alpha Cen (743 mas) right where Hipparcos (ESA 1997) had put it, i.e. slightly further away than derived by Soderhjelm (1999). The components are thus a bit more massive than previously thought (1.13 and 0.97 Msun for A and B respectively). These values are now in excellent agreement with the latest asteroseismologic results.},

	Abstract = {The vast majority of extrasolar planets are detected by indirect detection methods such as transit monitoring and radial velocity measurements. While these methods are very successful in detecting short-periodic planets, they are mostly blind to wide sub-stellar or even stellar companions on long orbits. In our study we present high resolution imaging observations of 63 exoplanet hosts carried out with the lucky imaging instrument AstraLux at the Calar Alto 2.2m telescope as well as with the new SPHERE high resolution adaptive optics imager at the ESO/VLT in the case of a known companion of specific interest. Our goal is to study the influence of stellar multiplicity on the planet formation process. We detected and confirmed 4 previously unknown stellar companions to the exoplanet hosts HD197037, HD217786, Kepler-21 and Kepler-68. In addition, we detected 11 new low-mass stellar companion candidates which must still be confirmed as bound companions. We also provide new astrometric and photometric data points for the recently discovered very close binary systems WASP-76 and HD2638. Furthermore, we show for the first time that the previously detected stellar companion to the HD185269 system is a very low mass binary. Finally we provide precise constraints on additional companions for all observed stars in our sample.},

	Abstract = {Infrared observations provide the dust composition in the protoplanetary discs surface layers, but can not probe the dust chemistry in the midplane, where planet formation occurs. Meteorites show that dynamics was important in determining the dust distribution in the Solar Nebula and needs to be considered if we are to understand the global chemistry in discs. 1D radial condensation sequences can only simulate one disc layer at a time and cannot describe the global chemistry or the complexity of meteorites. To address these limitations, we compute for the first time the two dimensional distribution of condensates in the inner Solar Nebula using a thermodynamic equilibrium model, and derive timescales for vertical settling and radial migration of dust. We find two enstatite-rich zones within 1 AU from the young Sun: a band ~0.1 AU thick in the upper optically-thin layer of the disc interior to 0.8 AU, and in the optically-thick disc midplane out to ~0.4 AU. The two enstatite-rich zones support recent evidence that Mercury and enstatite chondrites shared a bulk material with similar composition. Our results are also consistent with infrared observation of protoplanetary disc which show emission of enstatite-rich dust in the inner surface of discs. The resulting chemistry and dynamics suggests that the formation of the bulk material of enstatite chondrites occurred in the inner surface layer of the disc, within 0.4~AU. We also propose a simple alternative scenario in which gas fractionation and vertical settling of the condensates lead to an enstatite-chondritic bulk material.},

	Abstract = {First, distributions of surface densities of dust materials and gases in a preplanetary solar nebula, which give a good fit to the distribution of the planetary mass, are presented and the over-all structure of this nebula, which is in thermal and gravitational equilibrium, is studied. Second, in order to see magnetic effect on the structure, electric conductivity of a gas ionized by cosmic rays and radioactivities contained in dust grains is estimated for each region of the nebula and, then, the growth and decay of seed magnetic fields, which are due to differential rotation of the nebula and to the Joule dissipation, respectively, are calculated. The results indicate that, in regions of the terrestrial planets, magnetic fields decay much faster than they grow and magnetic effects can be ignored, except for the outermost layers of very low density. This is not the case for regions of Uranus and Neptune where magnetic fields can be amplified to considerable extents. Third, the transport of angular momentum due to magnetic and mechanical turbulent viscosities and the resultant redistribution of surface density in the nebula are investigated. The results show that the density redistribution occurs, in general, in a direction to attain a distribution of surface density which has nearly the same r-dependence as that obtained from the present distribution of the planetary mass. This redistribution seems to be possible if it occurs at a formation stage of the nebula where the presence of large viscosities is expected. Finally, a comment is given on the initial condition of a collapsing interstellar cloud from which the solar nebula is formed at the end of the collapse.},

	Abstract = {$K2$'s Campaign 9 ($K2$C9) will conduct a $\sim$3.4 deg$^{2}$ survey toward the Galactic bulge from 7/April through 1/July of 2016 that will leverage the spatial separation between $K2$ and the Earth to facilitate measurement of the microlens parallax $\pi_{\rm E}$ for $\gtrsim$120 microlensing events, including several planetary in nature as well as many short-timescale microlensing events, which are potentially indicative of free-floating planets (FFPs). These satellite parallax measurements will in turn allow for the direct measurement of the masses of and distances to the lensing systems. In this white paper we provide an overview of the $K2$C9 space- and ground-based microlensing survey. Specifically, we detail the demographic questions that can be addressed by this program, including the frequency of FFPs and the Galactic distribution of exoplanets, the observational parameters of $K2$C9, and the array of ground-based resources dedicated to concurrent observations. Finally, we outline the avenues through which the larger community can become involved, and generally encourage participation in $K2$C9, which constitutes an important pathfinding mission and community exercise in anticipation of $WFIRST$.},

	Abstract = {We describe an open source GPU implementation of a hybrid symplectic N-body integrator, GENGA (Gravitational ENcounters with Gpu Acceleration), designed to integrate planet and planetesimal dynamics in the late stage of planet formation and stability analyses of planetary systems. GENGA uses a hybrid symplectic integrator to handle close encounters with very good energy conservation, which is essential in long-term planetary system integration. We extended the second-order hybrid integration scheme to higher orders. The GENGA code supports three simulation modes: integration of up to 2048 massive bodies, integration with up to a million test particles, or parallel integration of a large number of individual planetary systems. We compare the results of GENGA to Mercury and pkdgrav2 in terms of energy conservation and performance and find that the energy conservation of GENGA is comparable to Mercury and around two orders of magnitude better than pkdgrav2. GENGA runs up to 30 times faster than Mercury and up to 8 times faster than pkdgrav2. GENGA is written in CUDA C and runs on all NVIDIA GPUs with a computing capability of at least 2.0.},

@article{Yang:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Surface liquid water is essential for standard planetary habitability. Calculations of atmospheric circulation on tidally locked planets around M stars suggest that this peculiar orbital configuration lends itself to the trapping of large amounts of water in kilometers-thick ice on the night side, potentially removing all liquid water from the day side where photosynthesis is possible. We study this problem using a global climate model including coupled atmosphere, ocean, land, and sea ice components as well as a continental ice sheet model driven by the climate model output. For a waterworld, we find that surface winds transport sea ice toward the day side and the ocean carries heat toward the night side. As a result, nightside sea ice remains {O}(10 m) thick and nightside water trapping is insignificant. If a planet has large continents on its night side, they can grow ice sheets {O}(1000 m) thick if the geothermal heat flux is similar to Earth's or smaller. Planets with a water complement similar to Earth's would therefore experience a large decrease in sea level when plate tectonics drives their continents onto the night side, but would not experience complete dayside dessiccation. Only planets with a geothermal heat flux lower than Earth's, much of their surface covered by continents, and a surface water reservoir {O}(10%) of Earth's would be susceptible to complete water trapping.},

	Abstract = {We analyse pre-Main Sequence evolutionary tracks for low mass stars with masses m <= 1.4 Msun based on the Baraffe et al. (\cite{Bar98}) input physics. We also extend the recent Chabrier et al. (2000) evolutionary models based on dusty atmosphere to young brown dwarfs down to one mass of Jupiter. We analyse current theoretical uncertainties due to molecular line lists, convection and initial conditions. Simple tests on initial conditions show the high uncertainties of models at ages la 1 Myr. We find a significant sensitivity of atmosphere profiles to the treatment of convection at low gravity and Teff < 4000 K, whereas it vanishes as gravity increases. This effect adds another source of uncertainty on evolutionary tracks at very early phases. We show that at low surface gravity (log g <~ 3.5) the common picture of vertical Hayashi lines with constant Teff is oversimplified. The effect of a variation of initial deuterium abundance is studied. We compare our models with evolutionary tracks available in the literature and discuss the main differences. We finally analyse to what extent current observations of young systems provide a good test for pre-Main Sequence tracks.},

@article{Shannon:2015aa,
	Abstract = {The Oort cloud is usually thought of as a collection of icy comets inhabiting the outer reaches of the Solar system, but this picture is incomplete. We use simulations of the formation of the Oort cloud to show that ˜4 per cent of the small bodies in the Oort cloud should have formed within 2.5 au of the Sun, and hence be ice-free rock-iron bodies. If we assume that these Oort cloud asteroids have the same size distribution as their cometary counterparts, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope should find roughly a dozen Oort cloud asteroids during 10 years of operations. Measurement of the asteroid fraction within the Oort cloud can serve as an excellent test of the Solar system's formation and dynamical history. Oort cloud asteroids could be of particular concern as impact hazards as their high mass density, high impact velocity, and low visibility make them both hard to detect and hard to divert or destroy. However, they should be a rare class of object, and we estimate globally catastrophic collisions should only occur about once per billion years.},

	Abstract = {Molecular snow lines in protoplanetary disks have been studied theoretically for decades because of their importance in shaping planetary architectures and compositions. The water snow line lies in the planet formation region at < 10 AU, and so far its location has been estimated only indirectly from spatially-unresolved spectroscopy. This work presents a proof-of-concept method to directly image the water snow line in protoplanetary disks through its physical and chemical imprint in the local dust properties. We adopt a physical disk model that includes dust coagulation, fragmentation, drift, and a change in fragmentation velocities of a factor 10 between dry silicates and icy grains as found by laboratory work. We find that the presence of a water snow line leads to a sharp discontinuity in the radial profile of the dust emission spectral index {\alpha}_mm, due to replenishment of small grains through fragmentation. We use the ALMA simulator to demonstrate that this effect can be observed in protoplanetary disks using spatially-resolved ALMA images in two continuum bands. We explore the model dependence on the disk viscosity and find that the spectral index reveals the water snow line for a wide range of conditions, with opposite trends when the emission is optically thin rather than thick. If the disk viscosity is low ({\alpha}_visc < 10^-3) the snow line produces a ring-like structure with a minimum at {\alpha}_mm ~ 2 in the optically thick regime, possibly similar to what has been measured with ALMA in the innermost region of the HL Tau disk.},

	Abstract = {Here, we present a set of time-dependent 3D RMHD simulations of a M-dwarf star representative of AD Leo, which extend from the upper convection zone into the chromosphere. The 3D model atmospheres are characterized by a very dynamic and intermittent structure on small spatial and temporal scales and a wealth of physical processes, which by nature cannot be described by means of 1D static model atmospheres. Artificial observations of these models imply that a combination of complementary diagnostics such as Ca II lines and the continuum intensity from UV to millimeter wavelengths, probe various properties of the dynamics, thermal and magnetic structure of the photosphere and the chromosphere and thus provide measures of stellar activity, which can be compared to observations. The complicated magnetic field structure and its imprint in synthetic diagnostics may have important implications for the understanding and characterization of stellar activity and with it possibly for the evaluation of planetary habitability around active M-dwarf stars.},

	Abstract = {In the coming decades, the discovery of the first truly Earth-like exoplanets is anticipated. The characterisation of those planets will play a vital role in determining which are chosen as targets for the search for life beyond the Solar system. One of the many variables that will be considered in that characterisation and selection process is the nature of the potential climatic variability of the exoEarths in question. In our own Solar system, the Earth's long-term climate is driven by several factors - including the modifying influence of life on our atmosphere, and the temporal evolution of Solar luminosity. The gravitational influence of the other planets in our Solar system add an extra complication - driving the Milankovitch cycles that are thought to have caused the on-going series of glacial and interglacial periods that have dominated Earth's climate for the past few million years. Here, we present the results of a large suite of dynamical simulations that investigate the influence of the giant planet Jupiter on the Earth's Milankovitch cycles. If Jupiter was located on a different orbit, we find that the long-term variability of Earth's orbit would be significantly different. Our results illustrate how small differences in the architecture of planetary systems can result in marked changes in the potential habitability of the planets therein, and are an important first step in developing a means to characterise the nature of climate variability on planets beyond our Solar system.},

	Abstract = {We calculate the pre-main-sequence habitable zone (HZ) for stars of spectral classes F-M. The spatial distribution of liquid water and its change during the pre-main-sequence phase of protoplanetary systems is important for understanding how planets become habitable. Such worlds are interesting targets for future missions because the coolest stars could provide habitable conditions for up to 2.5 billion years post-accretion. Moreover, for a given star type, planetary systems are more easily resolved because of higher pre-main-sequence stellar luminosities, resulting in larger planet-star separation for cool stars than is the case for the traditional main-sequence (MS) HZ. We use one-dimensional radiative-convective climate and stellar evolutionary models to calculate pre-main-sequence HZ distances for F1-M8 stellar types. We also show that accreting planets that are later located in the traditional MS HZ orbiting stars cooler than a K5 (including the full range of M stars) receive stellar fluxes that exceed the runaway greenhouse threshold, and thus may lose substantial amounts of water initially delivered to them. We predict that M-star planets need to initially accrete more water than Earth did, or, alternatively, have additional water delivered later during the long pre-MS phase to remain habitable. Our findings are also consistent with recent claims that Venus lost its water during accretion.},

	Abstract = {Efforts to identify habitable extrasolar planets have focused on systems around M dwarfs, faint stars with less than half the solar mass. Habitable planets around M dwarfs are thought to be more plentiful and easier to detect than those orbiting Sun-like G dwarfs. However, unlike G dwarfs, M dwarfs experience a prolonged decline in luminosity early in their history, leading to an inward migration of the habitable zone to where planets may have lost their water through dissociation and hydrodynamic escape. Water-poor planets, such as Venus, are considered uninhabitable. In contrast, planets with too much water (>1 wt%) would lack continents, leading to climate instability and nutrient limitation problems. Here we combine a numerical planet population synthesis model with a model for water loss to show that the evolution of stellar luminosity leads to two types of planets of Earth-like mass (0.1 to 10 Earth masses) in the habitable zones around M dwarfs: ocean planets without continents, and desert planets, on which there are orders of magnitude less surface water than on Earth. According to our simulations, Earth-mass planets with Earth-like water contents are rare around M dwarfs and occur 10-100 times less frequently than around G dwarfs. We suggest that stars close to the size of the Sun should be the primary targets for detecting Earth-like planets.},

	Abstract = {It is recently proposed that early stellar luminosity evolution of M dwarfs leads to severe water loss and the buildup of massive O2 atmospheres on rocky exoplanets in the habitable zone of these stars if interactions of such O2 atmospheres with planetary surfaces are inefficient. Here we show that even without considering atmosphere-surface interactions, the existence of a massive O2 atmosphere on such exoplanets is not an unavoidable consequence around M0-M3 stars and depends on stellar XUV properties, the mass of the exoplanets, and most importantly the initial planetary water inventories. In the case of inefficient atmosphere-surface interactions, the distribution of atmospheric O2 contents on these exoplanets should be bi-modal and such a distribution could be verified by future surveys of rocky exoplanets.},

@article{Zhou:2007aa,
	Abstract = {In the sequential accretion model, planets form through the sedimentation of dust, cohesive collisions of planetesimals, and coagulation of protoplanetary embryos prior to the onset of efficient gas accretion. As progenitors of terrestrial planets and the cores of gas giant planets, embryos have comparable masses and are separated by the full width of their feeding zones after the oligarchic growth. Within this context, we investigate the orbit-crossing time (Tc) of protoplanetary systems with equal planetary masses and initial separation k0 scaled by their mutual Hill radii (``EMS systems''). In a gas-free environment, log[Tc/(1 yr)] ~= A+Blog(k0/2.3), where A and B are functions of the planetary masses and initial eccentricities. This power law is caused by a random-walk diffusion of velocity dispersion sigma(t) in the EMS systems. The diffusion also leads to (1) a Rayleigh distribution of eccentricities with probability P(t)=(e/sigma2)exp[-e2/(2sigma2)] at time t and (2) an evolution of average eccentricity ~t1/2. As evidence of this chaotic diffusion, the observed eccentricities of known extrasolar planets obey a Rayleigh distribution. In a gaseous environment, as embryos become well separated (with k0~=6-12), their orbit-crossing tendency is suppressed by tidal drag, and their growth is stalled as their orbits are circularized. We evaluate the isolation masses of the embryos, which determine the probability of gas giant formation, as a function of the dust and gas surface densities.},

	Abstract = {The ubiquity of planets and diversity of planetary systems reveal that planet formation encompasses many complex and competing processes. In this series of papers, we develop and upgrade a population synthesis model as a tool to identify the dominant physical effects and to calibrate the range of physical conditions. Recent planet searches have led to the discovery of many multiple-planet systems. Any theoretical models of their origins must take into account dynamical interactions between emerging protoplanets. Here, we introduce a prescription to approximate the close encounters between multiple planets. We apply this method to simulate the growth, migration, and dynamical interaction of planetary systems. Our models show that in relatively massive disks, several gas giants and rocky/icy planets emerge, migrate, and undergo dynamical instability. Secular perturbation between planets leads to orbital crossings, eccentricity excitation, and planetary ejection. In disks with modest masses, two or less gas giants form with multiple super-Earths. Orbital stability in these systems is generally maintained and they retain the kinematic structure after gas in their natal disks is depleted. These results reproduce the observed planetary mass-eccentricity and semimajor axis-eccentricity correlations. They also suggest that emerging gas giants can scatter residual cores to the outer disk regions. Subsequent in situ gas accretion onto these cores can lead to the formation of distant (gsim 30 AU) gas giants with nearly circular orbits.},

	Abstract = {Radial velocity and transit surveys indicate that solar-type stars bear super-Earths, with masses up to ~20 M ⊕ and periods up to a few months, that are more common than those with Jupiter-mass gas giants. In many cases, these super-Earths are members of multiple-planet systems in which their mutual dynamical interaction has influenced their formation and evolution. In this paper, we modify an existing numerical population synthesis scheme to take into account protoplanetary embryos' interaction with their evolving natal gaseous disks, as well as their close scatterings and resonant interaction with each other. We show that it is possible for a group of compact embryos to emerge interior to the ice line, grow, migrate, and congregate into closely packed convoys which stall in the proximity of their host stars. After the disk-gas depletion, they undergo orbit crossing, close scattering, and giant impacts to form multiple rocky Earths or super-Earths in non-resonant orbits around ~0.1 AU with moderate eccentricities of ~0.01-0.1. We suggest that most refractory super-Earths with periods in the range of a few days to weeks may have formed through this process. These super-Earths differ from Neptune-like ice giants by their compact sizes and lack of a substantial gaseous envelope.},

@article{Ida:2008ab,
	Abstract = {We address two outstanding issues in the sequential accretion scenario for gas giant planet formation, the retention of dust grains in the presence of gas drag and that of cores despite type I migration. The efficiency of these processes is determined by the disk structure. Theoretical models suggest that planets form in protostellar disk regions with an inactive neutral ``dead zone'' near the midplane, sandwiched together by partially ionized surface layers where magnetorotational instability is active. Due to a transition in the abundance of dust grains, the active layer's thickness decreases abruptly near the ice line. Over a range of modest accretion rates (~10-9 to 10-8 Msolar yr-1), the change in the angular momentum transfer rate leads to local surface density and pressure distribution maxima near the ice line. The azimuthal velocity becomes super-Keplerian and the grains accumulate in this transition zone. This barrier locally retains protoplanetary cores and enhances the heavy-element surface density to the critical value needed to initiate efficient gas accretion. It leads to a preferred location and epoch of gas giant formation. We simulate and reproduce the observed frequency and mass-period distribution of gas giants around solar-type stars without having to greatly reduce the type I migration strength. The mass function of the short-period planets shows an enhanced population of super-Earths relative to hot Jupiters, and it can be utilized to calibrate the efficiency of type I migration and to extrapolate the fraction of stars with habitable terrestrial planets.},

	Abstract = {In a further development of a deterministic planet formation model (Ida & Lin), we consider the effect of type I migration of protoplanetary embryos due to their tidal interaction with their nascent disks. During the early phase of protostellar disks, although embryos rapidly emerge in regions interior to the ice line, uninhibited type I migration leads to their efficient self-clearing. But embryos continue to form from residual planetesimals, repeatedly migrate inward, and provide a main channel of heavy-element accretion onto their host stars. During the advanced stages of disk evolution (a few Myr), the gas surface density declines to values comparable to or smaller than that of the minimum mass nebula model, and type I migration is no longer effective for Mars-mass embryos. Over wide ranges of initial disk surface densities and type I migration efficiencies, the surviving population of embryos interior to the ice line has a total mass of several M⊕. With this reservoir, there is an adequate inventory of residual embryos to subsequently assemble into rocky planets similar to those around the Sun. However, the onset of efficient gas accretion requires the emergence and retention of cores more massive than a few M⊕ prior to the severe depletion of the disk gas. The formation probability of gas giant planets and hence the predicted mass and semimajor axis distributions of extrasolar gas giants are sensitively determined by the strength of type I migration. We suggest that the distributions consistent with observations can be reproduced only if the actual type I migration timescale is at least an order of magnitude longer than that deduced from linear theories.},

	Abstract = {The origin of a recently discovered close-in Neptune-mass planet around GJ 436 poses a challenge to the current theories of planet formation. On the basis of the sequential accretion hypothesis and the standard theory of gap formation and orbital migration, we show that around M dwarf stars, close-in Neptune-mass ice giant planets may be relatively common, while close-in Jupiter-mass gas giant planets are relatively rare. The mass distribution of close-in planets generally has two peaks at about Neptune mass and Jupiter mass. The lower mass peak takes the maximum frequency for M dwarfs. Around more massive solar-type stars (G dwarfs), the higher mass peak is much more pronounced. Planets around G dwarfs undergo orbital migration after fully accreting gas, while those around M dwarfs tend to migrate before starting rapid gas accretion. Close-in Neptune-mass planets may also exist around G dwarfs, although they tend to be mostly composed of silicates and iron cores and their frequency is expected to be much smaller than that of Neptune-mass planets around M dwarfs and that of gas giants around G dwarfs. We also show that the conditions for planets' migration due to their tidal interaction with the disk and the stellar mass dependence in the disk mass distribution can be calibrated by the mass distribution of short-period planets around host stars with various masses.},

	Abstract = {The apparent dependence of detection frequency of extrasolar planets on the metallicity of their host stars is investigated with Monte Carlo simulations using a deterministic core-accretion planet formation model. According to this model, gas giants formed and acquired their mass Mp through planetesimal coagulation followed by the emergence of cores onto which gas is accreted. These protoplanets migrate and attain their asymptotic semimajor axis a through tidal interaction with their nascent disk. Based on the observed properties of protostellar disks, we generate an Mp-a distribution. Our results reproduce the observed lack of planets with intermediate mass Mp=10-100 M⊕ and a<~3 AU and with large mass Mp>~103 M⊕ and a<~0.2 AU. Based on the simulated Mp-a distributions, we also evaluate the metallicity dependence of the fraction of stars harboring planets that are detectable with current radial velocity surveys. If protostellar disks attain the same fraction of heavy elements as contained in their host stars, the detection probability around metal-rich stars would be greatly enhanced because protoplanetary cores formed in them can grow to several Earth masses prior to their depletion. These large masses are required for the cores to initiate rapid gas accretion and to transform into giant planets. The theoretically extrapolated metallicity dependence is consistent with the observations. This correlation does not arise naturally in the gravitational-instability scenario. We also suggest other metallicity dependences of the planet distributions that can be tested by ongoing observations.},

	Abstract = {In the currently favoured core-accretion model, a giant planet begins life as a solid core that accumulates from smaller planetesimals. When a core reaches a critical size of roughly 10 Earth masses, it begins to accrete a massive gaseous envelope from the surrounding protoplanetary disk, forming a gas-giant planet. Current models predict that giant-planet cores will form within a protoplanetary disk before the disk gas disperses provided the disk is a few times more massive than the minimum-mass solar nebula. Gravitational interaction between a planetary core and the disk cause rapid inward type-I migration of the core. A 10-Earth-mass core initially at 5 AU will migrate into its star in less than 100,000 years in a minimum-mass nebula. Giant planets themselves open an annular gap in the disk and undergo slower type-II migration, moving with the viscous flow of the disk gas. Both type-I and type-II migration rates are sufficiently fast that it remains unclear how planets can form and survive in the presence of migration. Here, I will describe results of a new semi-analytic model for the growth and migration of planetary cores and giant planets designed to examine this issue. I will show that giant planets can form and survive under a range of conditions. In particular, low disk mass, low disk viscosity and small planetesimal size promote the formation and survival of giant planets. Migration remains substantial in most cases, leading to a wide range of outcomes. Planetary systems similar to the Solar System can occur, but only in a small fraction of parameter space.

	Abstract = {In an attempt to develop a deterministic theory for planet formation, we examine the accretion of cores of giant planets from planetesimals, gas accretion onto the cores, and their orbital migration. We adopt a working model for nascent protostellar disks with a wide variety of surface density distributions in order to explore the range of diversity among extrasolar planetary systems. We evaluate the cores' mass growth rate Mc through runaway planetesimal accretion and oligarchic growth. The accretion rate of cores is estimated with a two-body approximation. In the inner regions of disks, the cores' eccentricity is effectively damped by their tidal interaction with the ambient disk gas and their early growth is stalled by ``isolation.'' In the outer regions, the cores' growth rate is much smaller. If some cores can acquire more mass than a critical value of several Earth masses during the persistence of the disk gas, they would be able to rapidly accrete gas and evolve into gas giant planets. The gas accretion process is initially regulated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the planets' gas envelope. Based on the assumption that the exponential decay of the disk gas mass occurs on the timescales ~106-107 yr and that the disk mass distribution is comparable to those inferred from the observations of circumstellar disks of T Tauri stars, we carry out simulations to predict the distributions of masses and semimajor axes of extrasolar planets. In disks as massive as the minimum-mass disk for the solar system, gas giants can form only slightly outside the ``ice boundary'' at a few AU. However, cores can rapidly grow above the critical mass inside the ice boundary in protostellar disks with 5 times more heavy elements than those of the minimum-mass disk. Thereafter, these massive cores accrete gas prior to its depletion and evolve into gas giants. The limited persistence of the disk gas and the decline in the stellar gravity prevent the formation of cores capable of efficient gas accretion outside 20-30 AU. Unimpeded dynamical accretion of gas is a runaway process that is terminated when the residual gas is depleted either globally or locally in the form of a gap in the vicinity of their orbits. Since planets' masses grow rapidly from 10 to 100 M⊕, the gas giant planets rarely form with asymptotic masses in this intermediate range. Our model predicts a paucity of extrasolar planets with mass in the range 10-100 M⊕ and semimajor axis less than 3 AU. We refer to this deficit as a ``planet desert.'' We also examine the dynamical evolution of protoplanets by considering the effect of orbital migration of giant planets due to their tidal interactions with the gas disks, after they have opened up gaps in the disks. The effect of migration is to sharpen the boundaries and to enhance the contrast of the planet desert. It also clarifies the separation between the three populations of rocky, gas giant, and ice giant planets. Based on our results, we suggest that the planets' mass versus semimajor axes diagram can provide strong constraints on the dominant formation processes of planets analogous to the implications of the color-magnitude diagram on the paths of stellar evolution. We show that the mass and semimajor axis distributions generated in our simulations for the gas giants are consistent with those of the known extrasolar planets. Our results also indicate that a large fraction (90%-95%) of the planets that have migrated to within 0.05 AU must have perished. Future observations can determine the existence and the boundaries of the planet desert in this diagram, which can be used to extrapolate the ubiquity of rocky planets around nearby stars. Finally, the long-term dynamical interaction between planets of various masses can lead to both eccentricity excitation and scattering of planets to large semimajor axes. These effects are to be included in future models.},
