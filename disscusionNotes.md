Today we have a useful discussion again.

We decided to make our code public so more people can use it.

fig1: The line-like curve is good. As we already have this two series of simulations, we should get as much information from them as possible. We can plot a N(star-comet) vs N(star) figure and try to extrapolate the relation between them for realistic number of comets.



fig2: dot plot is unimaginative. We should add potential curve (how?) or distribution curve on it.



fig 3: we should cite result from two papers [Rainer and Peter] (which two? links needed!)

we need to add a code section in this paper, talking about code structure, performance, development, etc.



fig 4,5: theoretic analysis for these figures is needed! we need to explain why:

the fig5 red line drop, fig5 lagr red line and green line crossing by data, give the escaping particlesâ€™ velocity.

Also, we need some paragraph to explain why massless particles do not take part into mass segregation.

fig4,5 need to cite paper form (Rasol?)



fig 6: need to give in physical unit and line out the solar black hole limit.



fig 7,8: figure8 is not need. we will not talk about primordial binary system in this paper.

find out when and where is the captured comets from simulation data! (maybe plot a r-t plot? r is distance from binaries to cluster center; t is time. I plan to see many short curves)

also, as mentioned in fig 1, we should try to extrapolate the Ns-c - Nc relation from the 22 simulations, we can use

1) max number of Ns-c in a simulation

or

2) number of Ns-c when the star cluster is stable(between two collapsion)

We should plot the Ns-c vs Nc from simulation data, even if the result may shows high noise.

And we can refer this result to a paper of [Loeb? links needed]

Here we also need theoretic analysis to extrapolate result for trillions of comets and how many comets in solar system are captured by the sun.


I will go to Suzhou around 20th and work with Thijs for about one month. The plan is to finish the draft paper of free-floating comets during this period.


The latest version of paper is at https://github.com/qshu/paper

also this summary will be upload to github.
